  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a smart phone based mobile application designed for patients with Renal
      Cell and Prostate Cancer taking oral anti-cancer medications. (OAMs) All participants will
      be patients at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. Half of the
      participants will use the mobile application for a 3 month period along with their usual
      care. Half of the participants will just receive usual care.

      The investigators hope to show that cancer patients taking OAMs who use the mobile
      application will be better connected to their care team and will develop increased
      competency for self-care which will primarily increase medication adherence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The widespread and increasing use of oral anti-cancer medications (OAMs) has been ushered in
      by a rapidly increasing understanding of cancer pathophysiology. Furthermore, OAMs' popular
      ease of administration and potential cost savings has highlighted their central position in
      the healthcare system as a whole. Importantly, these facts have heightened appreciation of
      the unique challenges associated with OAMs use, especially in relation to prescribing,
      dispensing, reimbursement, education, adherence, and comprehensive quality and safety
      assurance. In this regard, the investigators goal is to improve medication adherence and
      clinical outcomes for cancer patients using OAMs through a mobile-enabled, multi-modal
      self-management and educational intervention .

      The intervention seeks to enable patients' self-efficacy to adhere to their medications
      through directed education and coaching, anticipation of symptoms and associated adverse
      events, and closer monitoring with accurate assessment of self-reported outcomes. This
      innovative approach necessarily includes personalizing feedback and management based on
      patients' own treatment regimen, baseline knowledge and elucidated barriers to adherence,
      and holds great promise in improving overall adherence, safety, and clinical outcomes in
      these patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that cancer patients on OAMs who use a mobile-based,
      multi-modal health self-management (M health) intervention designed for extensive patient
      education and symptom management will be better connected to their care team and will
      develop increased competency for self-care which will primarily increase medication
      adherence and improve secondary outcomes measured in this study compared to cancer patients
      on OAMs who do not use the mobile-based intervention.

    <description>Medication adherence will be measured throughout the course of the study by the Medication Event Monitoring System. (Continuous data regarding medication adherence will be measured through this device and recorded in real time throughout the study - a period of 3 months.) In addition, medication adherence will be measured at entry, mid-point and end of the study by the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, which all participants will complete at those time points.</description>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of fenretinide (4-HPR/LXS) plus
      ketoconazole in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal carcinoma.
      In addition, researchers would like to determine if the drugs are most effective together or
      if fenretinide (4-HPR/LXS) is most effective alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, an initial Phase I component of six patients will be conducted to monitor for
      potential toxicities as this wil be the initial adult experience of fenretinide (4-HPR)
      given together with ketoconazole

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent
             document

          2. Documented diagnosis of MDS (MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES), classified according to FAB
             (FRENCH-AMERICAN BRITISH)classification criteria

          3. Adequate course of treatment with an injectable hypomethylating agent (azacitidine
             for injection or decitabine) as the last therapeutic intervention for MDS
             (MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES) prior to beginning screening for this study. Adequate is
             defined as:

               -  having received at least 6 consecutive 4-week treatment cycles with azacitidine
                  for injection, or

               -  having received at least 4 consecutive 6-week treatment cycles with decitabine
                  (3-day regimen) or at least 6 consecutive 4-week treatment cycles with
                  decitabine (5-day regimen), or

               -  having demonstrated inability to tolerate treatment with an injectable
                  hypomethylating agent because of unacceptable drug-related toxicity after at
                  least 3 months of attempted treatment: Three 28-day cycles of azacitidine for
                  injection or decitabine 5-day regimen; two 42-day cycles of decitabine 3-day
                  regimen.

          4. Documented disease progression or stable disease as best response to treatment (or
             attempted treatment) with azacitidine for injection or decitabine. Those achieving an
             objective response to the most recent treatment regimen with an injectable HMA
             (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) are excluded from participation in this study. Definitions of
             disease progression are modified from IWG (INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUP) 2006 criteria
             and include:

               -  Pre-injectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) baseline bone marrow myeloblasts:

                    1. Less than 5%: ≥ 100% increase to ≥ 8% blasts

                    2. ≥ 5%: ≥ 50% increase to ≥ 10% blasts Note: ≥ 30% blasts is considered AML
                       (ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIAT) per FAB (FRENCH-AMERICAN BRITISH)classification.
                       Subjects known to have ≥ 30% blasts are not eligible for inclusion in this
                       study. RECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group)nizing limitations of
                       blast cell quantification, this protocol will allow subjects with
                       pre-enrollment bone marrow blast counts up to 33% on the screening bone
                       marrow examination to be considered for inclusion. Assessment may be made
                       according to local bone marrow examination to facilitate enrollment of
                       eligible subjects into the treatment phase of the study.

               -  Any clinical worsening from pre-injectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) baseline
                  condition, including:

                  a. sustained clinically-significant worsening (investigator's assessment) from
                  baseline granulocyte, platelet, or hemoglobin values (≥ 2 values, separated by ≥
                  2 weeks)

               -  worsening granulocytes should be ≥ 50% decrease from pre-injectable HMA
                  (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) baseline value

               -  worsening platelets should be ≥ 50% decrease from pre-injectable HMA
                  (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) baseline value (untransfused)

               -  worsening hemoglobin should be ≥ 1.5 g/dL decrease from preinjectable HMA
                  (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) baseline value in subjects not receiving RBC (RED BLOOD
                  CELL) transfusions b. meaningful worsening in RBC (RED BLOOD CELL) or platelet
                  transfusion requirement

             Definition of stable disease is based on modified IWG (INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUP)
             2006 criteria:

             - Failure to achieve any objective response (CR - complete remission, PR - partial
             remissino, mCR - marrow complete remission, or HI - hematologic improvement), but no
             evidence of disease progression within the 8 weeks leading to the subject's first
             dose of IP (INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT) in this study (Cycle 1, Day 1)

          5. Have the last dose of the prior treatment regimen (injectable HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING
             AGENT) - azacitidine for injection or decitabine) not more than 12 weeks prior to
             screening for this study (date of informed consent signature).

          6. No less than 3 weeks between the last dose of the prior treatment regimen (injectable
             HMA (HYPOMETHYLATING AGENT) - azacitidine for injection or decitabine) and the
             planned date of first dose of IP (IINVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT).

          7. Have an ECOG (EASTERN COOPERATIVE ONCOLOGY GROUP) performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          8. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)1 may participate, providing they meet the
             following conditions:

               -  Agree to use at least two effective contraceptive methods (oral, injectable, or
                  implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal ligation; intra-uterine device;
                  barrier contraceptive with spermicide; true abstinence; or vasectomized partner)
                  throughout the study, and for 90 days following the last dose of IP
                  (INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT); and

               -  Have a negative serum pregnancy test (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) at
                  screening; and

               -  Have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (investigator's discretion) within
                  72 hours prior to starting treatment with IP (INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT) (Cycle 1,
                  Day 1), and before beginning each subsequent cycle of treatment.

             Note that the screening serum pregnancy test can also be used as the test prior to
             starting IP (INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT) if it is performed within the 72-hour
             timeframe.

          9. Male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential must agree to use at
             least two physician-approved contraceptive methods throughout the course of the study
             and should avoid fathering a child during the course of the study and for 90 days
             following the last dose of IP (INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT).

         10. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document prior to any
             study-related assessments or procedures conducted.

         11. Understand and voluntarily sign a biomarker-specific component of the informed
             consent document prior to any study-related procedures conducted.

             known to have ≥ 30% blasts are not eligible for inclusion in this study. Recognizing
             limitations of blast cell quantification, this protocol will allow subjects with
             pre-enrollment (screening/baseline) bone marrow blast counts up to 33% to be

               -  Serum total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal). Higher levels are
                  acceptable if these can be attributed to active red blood cell precursor
                  destruction within the bone marrow (ie, ineffective erythropoiesis). Subjects
                  are excluded if there is evidence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia manifested as a

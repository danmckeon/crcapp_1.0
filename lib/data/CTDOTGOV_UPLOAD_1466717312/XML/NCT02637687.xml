      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study in pediatric patients with advanced solid
      or primary CNS tumors. LOXO‑101 will be administered orally (PO) twice daily (BID), with the
      dose adjusted by body surface area (BSA).

      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study in pediatric patients with advanced solid
      or primary CNS tumors. LOXO‑101 will be administered orally (PO) twice daily (BID), with the
      dose adjusted by body surface area (BSA).

      Dose Escalation Phase Escalation will proceed through the planned 4 dose levels, or until
      the MTD is reached, or until the Sponsor determines that a suitable dose has been achieved
      based on PK exposure.

      Expansion Cohorts Additional patient cohorts may be enrolled to better characterize safety
      and efficacy in patients with specific abnormalities in the NTRK genes or proteins.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pediatric patients ≥ 1 year old on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1)

          -  Locally advanced or metastatic solid or primary CNS tumor that has progressed, or was
             nonresponsive to available therapies, and for which no standard or available curative
             therapy exists

          -  Or patients ≥ 1 month old with a diagnosis of infantile/congenital fibrosarcoma, with
             a documented NTRK fusion that has progressed, or was nonresponsive to available
             therapies and for which no standard or available curative therapy exists

          -  Karnofsky (those 16 years old or older) or Lansky (those younger than 16 years)
             performance score of at least 50

          -  Adequate hematologic function: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 109/L, platelet
             count ≥ 100.0 109/L and hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL (patients with bone marrow involvement
             will not be evaluable for hematologic DLT and can enroll with ANC ≥ 0.75 109/L,

             the Cockroft-Gault formula or: a serum creatinine based on age/gender as outlined in
             the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigational agent, anticancer therapy, or major surgery within 28 days (4 weeks)
             prior to C1D1

          -  Symptomatic brain metastases, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, or spinal cord
             compression

             interval corrected for heart rate (QTc)

          -  Current treatment with a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor or inducer
             (EIAEDs and dexamethasone for CNS tumors or metastases, on a stable dose, are
             allowed)

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study of orally administered CB-5083 in adult
      subjects with advanced metastatic solid tumors. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: an
      initial Dose Escalation Phase (Phase 1a) of CB-5083 in subjects with advanced metastatic
      solid tumors who have progressed or are non-responsive to available therapies and for which
      no standard therapy exists, followed by a Dose Expansion Phase (Phase 1b) which will include
      1 to 4 arms: one arm in subjects with RAS mutated mCRC; optionally, at sponsors discretion,
      3 additional arms may be added for subjects with advanced RCC, advanced pNET, or solid
      tumors with mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway.

      The objectives of the Dose Escalation Phase are to determine the safety, tolerability, PK
      and pharmacodynamic profiles as well as the MTD and/or RP2D of orally administered CB-5083.
      The objectives of the dose expansion phase are to confirm the safety and tolerability of the
      RP2D, to further assess the PK and pharmacodynamic profiles and to evaluate the preliminary
      anti-tumor activity of CB-5083 in subjects with tumors for which there is biologic
      plausibility of unique sensitivity to CB-5083 mechanism of action (MOA) based on
      pre-clinical data.

             drug administration, may interfere with the informed consent process and/or with
             compliance with the requirements of the study, or may interfere with the
             interpretation of the study results and, in the Investigator's opinion, would make
             the subject inappropriate for entry into this study;

         19. Use of any investigational agents within 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             shorter) prior to Baseline;

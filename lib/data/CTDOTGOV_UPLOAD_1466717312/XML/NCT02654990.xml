  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of three different
      regimens of PAN (20 mg TIW, 20 mg BIW, and 10 mg TIW) in combination with s.c. BTZ and Dex
      and to provide exposure, safety and efficacy data to identify the optimal regimen of PAN in
      a randomized, 3-arm parallel design. This study will also assess the impact of administering
      s.c. BTZ (in combination with PAN and Dex) twice weekly for 4 cycles, and then weekly
      starting from Cycle 5 until disease progression in patients ≤ 75 years of age. Patients &gt; 75
      years of age will receive for the entire treatment period s.c. BTZ weekly (in combination
      with PAN and Dex) until disease progression.

      Patients will be treated until disease progression or until they discontinue earlier due to
      unacceptable toxicity or for other reasons.

      Patients who discontinued study treatment for reasons other than disease progression will be
      followed for efficacy every 6 weeks.

      All patients will be followed for survival until the last patient entering long-term
      follow-up has completed a 3 year survival follow-up or discontinued earlier.

      This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center trial designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CUDC-907 administered orally to subjects with
      advanced/relapsed solid tumors. The following dosing schedules may be examined, each
      consisting of 21-day treatment cycles:

        1. Three days weekly on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, and 19 (TIW schedule).

        2. Five days on/two days off on Days 1 to 5, 8 to 12, and 15 to 19 (5/2 schedule).

      3. Four days on/three days off on Days 1 to 4, 8 to 11, and 15 to 18 (4/3 schedule).

             or midline carcinoma with NUT rearrangement, that has progressed despite standard
             therapy, or for which no standard therapy exists. In the case of breast cancer, this
             must be ER+ or PR+, Her2 negative disease (women only) with disease progression on at
             least one prior hormonal therapy for advanced/metastatic disease or disease relapse

             and topical corticosteroids are permitted, as is replacement dosing of steroids
             (defined as &lt;30 mg/day hydrocortisone or the equivalent) provided that the subject
             has been on a stable or tapering dose for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of
             CUDC-907

         10. Second primary malignancy within two years of study entry that requires active
             treatment

         11. Known gastrointestinal condition that would interfere with swallowing or oral
             absorption/tolerance of CUDC-907

         12. Known positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B surface

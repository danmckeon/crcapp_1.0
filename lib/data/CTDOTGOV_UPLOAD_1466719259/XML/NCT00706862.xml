  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the combination of talactoferrin,
      carboplatin and paclitaxel improves progression free survival and overall survival in
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer compared to the combination of paclitaxel and
      carboplatin alone

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of brain metastases, unless the patient received brain irradiation,
             including adequate stereotactic radiosurgery, at least 4 weeks prior to
             randomization, and is stable, asymptomatic, and off steroids for at least 3 weeks

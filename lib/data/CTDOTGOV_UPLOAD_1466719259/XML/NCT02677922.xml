      This Phase 1b/2 study is an open-label, randomized, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of oral AG-120 + SC azacitidine and oral A-221 + Subcutaneous (SC) azacitidine
      in subjects with newly diagnosed Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring an Isocitrate
      dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or an Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutation, respectively. The
      study population consists of subjects who are not candidates to receive intensive IC. The
      study comprises a Phase 1b dose-escalation stage and a Phase 2 randomized stage.

          3. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

          4. Subject has previously untreated, primary (ie, de novo) or secondary (progression of
             Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasms [MPN], or

             mutation (R132, R140, or R172)

               -  IDH mutational status will be assessed locally; for sites without local testing
                  capabilities, a referral lab will be identified.

                    -  By the investigator's assessment who are not candidates to receive
                       intensive Inductive chemotherapy (IC).

                  occlusion; intra-uterine device; intrauterine hormone-releasing system; or male
                  partner sterilization) at screening and throughout the study, and for 4 months
                  following the last study treatment; and

               -  Have a negative serum β-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG)
                  pregnancy test (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) at screening; and

               -  Have a negative serum β hCG pregnancy test (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL)
                  within 72 hours prior to the start of study treatment in the Treatment Period
                  (note that the screening serum pregnancy test can be used as the test prior to
                  the start of study treatment in the Treatment Period if it is performed within
                  the 72 hour timeframe).

             conditions in criterion 8) must agree to abstain** from sexual intercourse or agree
             to the use of highly effective contraceptive methods (at screening and throughout the
             course of the study) and should avoid fathering a child during the course of the
             study and for 4 months following the last study treatment (6 months following the
             last dose of azacitidine in Canada).

               -  A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who 1) has not
                  undergone a hysterectomy (the surgical removal of the uterus) or bilateral
                  oophorectomy (the surgical removal of both ovaries) or bilateral salpingectomy

                  naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out
                  childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses
                  at any time during the preceding 24 consecutive months). Amenorrhea at age &gt;45
                  years for over 6 months with follicle-stimulating hormone level &gt; 40 IU/L is
                  normally acceptable for ruling out childbearing potential.

                    -  Abstinence is only accepted as a method of contraception when it is the
                       preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence
                       (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus
                       interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM)
                       are not considered to be acceptable methods of contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Subject is suspected or proven to have acute promyelocytic leukemia based on
             morphology, immunophenotype, molecular assay, or karyotype.

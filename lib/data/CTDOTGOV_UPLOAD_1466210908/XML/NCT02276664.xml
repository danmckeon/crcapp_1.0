  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test a self-help smoking cessation treatment for
      patients receiving a lung cancer screening computed tomography (CT) scan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conduct Formative Research (Months 1 - 4): Identification of emergent themes and responses
      to existing booklets.

      Adapt and Refine Booklets (Months 5 - 8): Advanced drafts of booklets.

      Final Reactions to Draft Booklets (Months 9 - 12): Series of smoking cessation booklets for
      spiral computed tomography (CT) patients.

    <measure>Study 2 - Rate of Seven-Day Abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>Seven-day abstinence will be assessed at each follow-up, allowing for calculation of point-prevalence abstinence rates. For this pilot, we will not bioverify self-reported abstinence.</time_frame>

    <measure>Rate of Intervention Demand</measure>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Demand will be estimated by noting accrual rates into the study.</description>

    <measure>Degree of Practicality</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Practicality encompasses the degree to which investigators are able to carry out all the piloted elements of the planned randomized control trial (RCT) successfully and efficiently (i.e., recruitment, screening, randomization, and follow-up).</description>

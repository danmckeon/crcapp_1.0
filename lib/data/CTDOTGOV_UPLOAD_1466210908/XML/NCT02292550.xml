    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/II study of the ALK inhibitor ceritinib in combination with the CDK4/6
      inhibitor LEE011 in patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the MTD/RP2D of the LEE011 and ceritinib
      combination and evaluate whether the combination is safe and has beneficial effects in
      ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients.

          -  Patients must be diagnosed with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC. The tumor must be
             ALK-positive as determined by ALK rearrangement in ≥15% of cells (as measured by FISH
             using the Vysis break-apart ALK probe) or by using the Ventana ALK IHC test. The
             analysis may be performed locally.

          -  Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.

          -  Measurable disease as per RECIST v1.1

          -  Availability of tumor sample:

        For ALK inhibitor naïve patients:

        o A representative tumor sample must be submitted. An archival tumor specimen is
        acceptable

        For patients after progression on an ALK inhibitor:

        o A new tumor biopsy is required unless a biopsy performed after progression on the
        patient's most recent ALK inhibitor is available for submission For all patients a newly
        obtained tumor specimen must be submitted if no appropriate archival sample is available.
        In the event that no sample is available and a new biopsy cannot be obtained, enrollment
        may be considered after discussion with the sponsor.

        syndrome, or any of the following:

          -  Risk factors for Torsades de Pointe (TdP) including uncorrected hypokalemia or
             hypomagnesemia, history of cardiac failure, or history of clinically
             significant/symptomatic bradycardia

             to cause Torsades de Pointe that cannot be discontinued or replaced by safe

             drug)

          -  Inability to determine the QTcF interval Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias

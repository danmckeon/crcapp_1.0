        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant has Stage IV NSCLC.

               -  Part A: NSCLC Stage IV (any type)

               -  Part B: NSCLC Stage IV (squamous and nonsquamous)

          -  The participant must have progressed after 1 platinum-based chemotherapy regimen.
             Prior treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase
             inhibitor and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors is mandatory in patients
             whose tumor has an EGFR activating mutation or ALK translocations. Prior vascular
             endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor-targeting agents and
             neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapies are permitted.

          -  Measurable disease at the time of study entry as defined by Response Evaluation
             Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).

          -  The participant has tumor tissue available for biomarker analyses.

          -  The participant has adequate organ function.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) score of 0-1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant is currently enrolled in a clinical trial involving an
             investigational product or non-approved use of a drug or device.

          -  Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or
             anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 antibody (including ipilimumab or
             any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint
             pathways) or EGFR-directed monoclonal antibody (mAb) is not permitted.

          -  Have a serious concomitant systemic disorder or significant cardiac disease.

          -  The participant has undergone major surgery or received any investigational therapy
             in the 30-days prior to study enrollment.

          -  The participant has undergone chest irradiation within 4 weeks prior to receiving
             study treatment.

          -  The participant has brain metastases that are symptomatic.

          -  The participant has a history of arterial thromboembolism event (ATE) or venous
             thromboembolism event (VTE) within 3 months prior to study enrollment. Participants
             with history of VTE beyond 3 months prior to study enrollment can be enrolled if they
             are appropriately treated with low molecular weight heparin.

          -  The participant has a known allergy / history of hypersensitivity reaction to any of
             the treatment components, including any ingredient used in the formulation of
             necitumumab or pembrolizumab, or any other contraindication to one of the
             administered treatments.

          -  The participant is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  The participant has a concurrent active malignancy. Previous history of malignancy is
             permitted, provided that the participant has been free of disease for ≥3 years, with
             the exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,
             preinvasive carcinoma of the cervix, or any cancers that in the judgment of the
             investigator and sponsor may not affect the interpretation of results (for example,
             prostate, bladder).

          -  History of interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis, autoimmune disease or syndrome
             that requires steroids or immunosuppressive agents.

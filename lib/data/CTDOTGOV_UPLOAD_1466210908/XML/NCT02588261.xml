  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the progression free survival (PFS), based on
      independent radiologic review (IRR), of ASP8273 compared to erlotinib or gefitinib in
      patients with locally advanced, metastatic or unresectable stage IIIB/IV adenocarcinoma
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating
      mutations.

      This study will also assess Overall survival (OS); Overall response rate (ORR) as assessed
      by IRR; PFS as assessed by the investigator; Disease control rate (DCR) as assessed by IRR;
      Duration of Response (DOR) by IRR; Safety of ASP8273; and Quality of Life (QOL) and
      patient-reported outcome (PRO) parameters.

          -  Subject has difficulty taking oral medication or any digestive tract dysfunction or
             inflammatory bowel disease that would interfere with the intestinal absorption of

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to facilitate application of the known biomarkers to patients
      presenting today, and to establish a collection of biospecimens that will be useful for
      discovering and validating new biomarkers for future use.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of the historically poor outcomes of lung cancer patients, suboptimal therapeutic
      efficacy, and significant side effects of chemotherapy, and the need to choose more
      efficacious treatment regimens, and patients most likely to benefit from them, there is a
      need to predict a priori whether an individual patient's tumor will respond to a particular
      therapeutic agent. However, virtually all lung cancer tumor samples available today are from
      resection specimens so direct, intra-patient molecular-clinical therapy correlations are
      impossible.

      Without the critical mass of tissue and data necessary to identify optimal molecular targets
      for lung cancer and drugs active against these targets, new discoveries that offer the only
      hope of long-term survival for many lung cancer patients remain elusive.

      This study facilitates the collection of biospecimens from advanced lung cancer patients and
      routine determination of a panel of documented clinically significant biomarkers. In
      addition, it will centrally integrate and standardize research tissue samples with
      corresponding proteomic, genomic, molecular and clinical data across a multitude of
      institutions and oncology networks

    <description>This is a multi-cohort parallel study in which tumor, plasma and serum samples will be collected prior to the start of any therapeutic intervention for stage IV lung cancer. These biospecimens will be correlated with treatment and clinical data and distributed for peer reviewed research purposes to academic and community centers in the U.S. and Europe.
The biospecimens collected in CASTLE will be analyzed for a panel of biomarkers, currently including:
tumor: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), KRAS (Kirsten RAt Sarcoma) gene and EML4-ALK (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 - anaplastic lymphoma kinase) translocations, and EGFR, TS (thymidylate synthase), ERCC1 (excision repair cross-complementing 1) and RRM1 (Ribonucleotide Reductase, M1 Subunit) gene expressions
serum: proteomics predictive for EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibotors)response</description>

             tumor was not, then the latter could still be biopsied and the subject enrolled after
             radiation therapy of the brain metastasis (and vice versa)).

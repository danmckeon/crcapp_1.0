    <textblock>
      While recent advances in the treatment of metastatic melanoma and NSCLC (non-small cell lung
      cancer) with agents targeting PD-1 are striking, there remains a significant need to develop
      therapies for patients with untreated brain metastases who were excluded from prior trials
      with MK-3475 and the majority of other studies in these diseases. The brain is a common site
      of disease spread in many solid tumors, most notably metastatic melanoma and NSCLC. 10-40%
      of patients with metastatic melanoma develop brain metastases during their lifetime and &gt;75%
      have brain metastases at autopsy. Overall, historical melanoma patient cohorts have reported
      a median survival of patients with brain metastases in the order of 2.5 - 4 months despite
      use of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and surgery. One older patient series showed a
      median survival of &lt; 4 months in melanoma patients with brain metastases and a neurological
      death rate of &gt;30% despite the treatment of intracranial metastases with whole brain
      radiation therapy (WBRT). Among those with NSCLC, 10% have brain metastases at presentation
      and another 30% develop them over the course of their disease. Survival after the
      development of brain metastases is as dismal in those with NSCLC as it is for melanoma.
      Multifocal disease is common in both of these diseases, with about half of patients with CNS
      disease presenting with more than one brain lesion.

      Patients with untreated brain metastases have been excluded from most clinical trials of
      systemic therapy for two reasons: (1) historically their prognosis has been poor (overall
      survival â‰¤ 4 months) and (2) experimental drugs are presumed to not penetrate the blood
      brain barrier (BBB) or BBB penetration is not well studied. In melanoma, for example, one
      phase III study evaluating ipilimumab excluded patients with untreated brain metastases and
      another study evaluating ipilimumab and dacarbazine excluded all patients with a history of
      brain metastases, regardless of prior treatment. A subsequent trial with ipilimumab for
      patients with untreated brain metastases indeed showed that the drug had some activity in
      treating CNS disease. In the initial vemurafenib studies, patients with progressing or
      unstable CNS metastases were excluded. The pivotal BRIM-3 trial excluded patients with brain
      metastases unless metastases had been definitively treated more than three months prior to
      trial enrollment. Both temodar and sorafenib cross the BBB. Initial studies with sorafenib
      alone and in combination with chemotherapy excluded patients with active brain metastases. A
      combination study of temodar and sorafenib in patients with or without brain metastases
      showed modest activity in patients without a history of prior temodar, and was thought to be
      favorable in part due to local therapies. Although a number of studies have been conducted
      for melanoma patients with untreated brain metastases using established therapies, most
      initial clinical trials with novel agents exclude these patients. A recent trial with
      dabrafenib, an inhibitor of mutated B-raf, is an exception to the long-standing paradigm. A
      phase I/II study of this agent included a subset of patients with untreated brain
      metastases. At the 2010 meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology, Long et al
      reported that nine of the ten patients with untreated cerebral metastases enrolled in this
      trial had shrinkage of their brain lesions. This was the basis for a recent phase II trial
      of dabrafenib specific for patients with untreated brain metastases61. In NSCLC, a small
      number of trials have shown that combination chemotherapy regimens can induce a response in
      the CNS with untreated brain metastases with a median PFS up to 4 months. These studies
      demonstrate that asymptomatic brain metastases, similar to asymptomatic metastases in other
      sites, can be treated systemically on clinical trials, and that drug activity in the CNS is
      not necessarily different than in other metastatic locations.

      Current standard of care for brain metastases that require immediate local intervention
      (based on symptoms, location, size, or other concerning features) is craniotomy with
      resection or radiation therapy. As an adjunct to standard craniotomy, LITT is emerging as a
      new, minimally invasive local therapy to treat previously surgically inaccessible brain
      metastases. Not only is cell death instantaneous, thus decreasing the risk of delayed
      intra-tumoral hemorrhage, but another theoretical advantage of using LITT as part of
      management of brain metastases is that the hyperthermia breaks down the blood brain barrier
      at the edge of the coagulation region thereby possibly increasing access of chemotherapeutic
      agents into the lesion. In patients in whom either craniotomy or LITT are performed,
      biopsies of tumor and surrounding normal brain can also be obtained at the time of local
      therapy.

      The purpose of this trial is to study the activity of MK-3475 in untreated brain metastases
      from melanoma or NSCLC. Given the promising initial results of MK-3475 in these diseases but
      the lack of data in patients with untreated brain metastases thus far, this trial will study
      treatment in this patient population. Additionally, for patients with melanoma this trial
      requires local therapy with craniotomy or LITT to at least 1 brain lesion prior to systemic
      therapy, thereby allowing the acquisition of brain tumor tissue for correlative studies on
      biomarkers that may be predictive of clinical response in the CNS and systemically. We will
      also require a biopsy of an extra-cerebral metastasis when feasible, particularly when
      tissue from the brain lesion is not obtained in patients with NSCLC.

    <description>Response will be evaluated after 8 weeks of systemic therapy and then every 8 weeks thereafter. The purpose of the 4 weeks scans is to determine safety. If sysmptoms develop or clinical deterioration occurs, patients may be imaged prior to the pre-specified time points for imaging. All responses must be confirmed by repeat imaging at least 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response.</description>

    <description>RECIST criteria v1.1 will be modified to account for differences in measuring the response of clinically evaluable brain lesions as opposed to systemic lesions (modified RECIST, or mRECIST). Size is considered the tumor's largest diameter. Measurements from multiple lesions are summed to calculate the sum of the diameters (SD). The SD calculated on a baseline scan performed within 28 days of study drug initiation will be used as a reference to determine the objective response of the clinically evaluable lesions. All responses must be confirmed at 4 weeks with an equivalent or better response. Please refer to the original RECIST criteria if further reference is necessary.</description>

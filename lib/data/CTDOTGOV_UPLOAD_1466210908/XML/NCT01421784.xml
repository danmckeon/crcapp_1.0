  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the researchers investigate the feasibility of using rapid cine MR imaging to
      provide both offline and online soft-tissue-based image guidance. Such images will provide a
      significantly more complete picture of the spatial and temporal changes in thoracic anatomy.
      This more complete information will lay the groundwork for better radiotherapy planning and
      dose delivery in the presence of respiratory motion.

      Rapid MRI scans from Stage I-IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients will be
      acquired. MR acquisition will be performed without extrinsically administered contrast,
      using a balanced turbo field echo (TFE) sequence and commercially available coils.

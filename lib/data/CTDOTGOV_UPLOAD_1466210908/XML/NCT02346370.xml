      A Phase 1b/2 study for patients with Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC to participate in one of three
      portions of this study. The first portion is dose escalation in which subjects are tested
      with PEGPH20 at various doses (1.6, 3.0, 4.0, 5.3 and 7.0 ug/kg) and dosing schedules
      (either once every 21 day cycle or twice/week or 6 times/21 day cycle) plus a standard dose
      of docetaxel (75mg/m2 once every 3 weeks) until the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) is reached
      in both dosing schedules. The second portion is a randomized schedule finding component in
      which the MTDs of both dosing schedules are tested (approximately 25-30 subjects) and the
      most safe, efficacious and tolerated dose/schedule is chosen to be tested in the Phase 2
      portion. Phase 2 will compare the selected dose schedule of PEGPH20 plus docetaxel with
      docetaxel alone.

      This is a Phase 1b/2 study for subjects with Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC to participate in one of
      three portions of this study. The first portion of the Phase 1b is dose escalation which
      will enroll approximating 20-30 subjects testing various dose levels of PEGPH20 (1.6, 3.0,
      4.0, 5.3 and 7.0 ug/kg) plus docetaxel 75mg/m2 once every 3 weeks until the MTD is found for
      both dosing schedules (Schedule A, PEGPH20 plus docetaxel every 21 day cycle and Schedule B,
      PEGPH20 twice per week/per 21 day cycle or 6 times/cycle) plus docetaxel (once every 3
      weeks) . The second portion of the phase 1b is the Schedule finding component. This portion
      will enroll approximately 25-30 subjects and will randomize (1:1) approximately 10 subjects
      in each schedule (Schedule A or B) at the MTD dose. After the Phase 1b is completed, all
      data will be analyzed and the most safe, best tolerated and most efficacious dose and
      schedule of PEGPH20 plus docetaxel (PDoc) will be used in the Phase 2 portion.

      In Phase 2, approximately 188 subjects will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive
      PEGPH20 plus docetaxel (75mg/m2) or docetaxel (75mg/m2) alone. Subjects in both the Schedule
      finding and Phase 2 portions of the study will be pre-selected for high levels of hyaluronan
      (HA) in tumor tissue during screening. Subjects must have failed a platinum based therapy
      (1st line). Subjects to remain on study as long as tolerated, until disease progression or
      experience an adverse event.

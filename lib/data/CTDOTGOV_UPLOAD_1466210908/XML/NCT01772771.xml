  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to perform standardized testing of tumor tissue to learn
      which genes are mutated (have changed) to provide personalized cancer therapy options to
      patients at MD Anderson. Your doctor may be able to use testing information on your tumor to
      identify clinical trials that may be most relevant to you.

      Another goal of this laboratory research study is to learn how often different genes mutate
      in patients with different cancers. Researchers will also use the information learned from
      this study to develop a database of the different kinds of mutations in cancer-related
      genes.

      Researchers also hope to better understand how mutations in cancer-related genes may affect
      a patient's response to different therapies. Researchers can use this information to select
      specific therapies for future patients that are more likely to be effective.

      If you agree to take part in this study, information about your disease and your previous
      and future treatments and outcomes will be recorded from your medical records. A sample of
      your tumor tissue that was already collected and stored at MD Anderson or another
      institution will be collected.

      If your tumor tissue is stored at another institution, a company called eHealth Global that
      specializes in picking up and delivering this kind of tissue, may be used to collect and
      deliver your samples to MD Anderson. If eHealth Global is used, they may have access to
      certain identifiable health information, which will include the accession number of your
      tissue sample, your demographic information (to know where to pick up the sample), and your
      Medical Record Number (used to label the sample so that the laboratory knows that it is for
      your tests). eHealth Global will not keep this information and it will only be used to move
      your samples from the outside institution to MD Anderson.

      Your medical record information will be entered into a password-protected database that can
      only be accessed by authorized members of the research staff and your treating physician at
      MD Anderson.

      The tissue sample will be tested to look for mutations in cancer-related genes. Any leftover
      DNA will be stored in a research bank at MD Anderson for future research related to this
      study.

      Before your samples can be used for research outside of this study, the people doing the
      research must get specific approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of MD
      Anderson. The IRB is a committee made up of doctors, researchers, and members of the
      community. The IRB is responsible for protecting the participants involved in research
      studies and making sure all research is done in a safe and ethical manner. All research done
      at MD Anderson, including research involving your samples from this bank, must first be
      approved by the IRB.

      Your samples will be given a code number. Researchers in the laboratory will not have
      identifying information directly linked to your samples. However, the researchers in charge
      of this study and their team members, as well as your oncologist will be able to link the
      samples to you. This is to allow medical data related to the samples to be updated as
      needed. Other researchers using your samples will not be able to link this data to you.

      Some of your sample material may be sent to institutions outside of MD Anderson for advanced
      testing.

      If your sample material is sent to outside institutions or companies (e.g. Guardant Health
      Inc.) for CLIA-verified advanced testing, your name and a sample identifier, along with
      information about your sample and disease that are necessary to complete the testing will be
      provided along with your sample. The information from the CLIA-certified tests done at
      outside companies or institutions will become part of your medical record.

      If your sample is sent to outside institutions for standard research testing only, no
      identifying information about you will be included with the sample. Results from standard
      research tests from outside companies or institutions will not be included in your medical
      record and you will not receive information about the results of these tests.

      Return of Information and Data Sharing:

      The kind of genetic research done in this study has the potential to identify unsuspected
      genetic mutations (changes). These may change your risk for:

        -  Hereditary cancer

        -  Side effects of specific drugs or procedures

        -  Serious but treatable conditions (like heart disease)

        -  Serious, but untreatable conditions (like Alzheimer's disease, polycystic kidney
           disease)

      If you are a carrier of a genetic mutation, your children or other family members may also
      have a hereditary risk for serious diseases.

      Length of Study:

      Your active participation will be over after you sign this consent form and your tissue and
      blood samples have been collected. You medical records may continue to be reviewed for up to
      20 years.

      If during the genetic analysis, genetic mutations that are relevant to the care of yourself
      or your family members are found, the researchers will try to return this information to
      you. However, analysis may not be immediately done, and lack of information should not be
      perceived as lack of genetic findings. Importantly, new scientific findings occur frequently
      and your genetic analysis may not be repeated when new disease-related genes are discovered.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 8,000 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically documented invasive cancer,
             suspected glioma, sarcoma, melanoma or hematologic cancer. Patients with benign
             tumors may also be consented at the discretion of the attending physician if
             molecular profiling is felt to have potential clinical implications.

          2. Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

          3. Patients may be consented without confirming the amount and quality of archival
             diagnostic or residual tissue available. However, research testing will only be
             performed on patients who have sufficient archived diagnostic tissue or residual
             tissue banked in one of the authorized tissue banks at MD Anderson available to
             proceed with testing. The extent of testing may be modified based on amount of tissue
             available. If any new tissue acquisition including a biopsy and/or surgical resection
             etc. is being ordered for clinical care or another research study, or an operation is
             being performed testing can be ordered on that sample.

          4. cfDNA Cohort: Circulating cell-free DNA next generation sequencing (NGS) testing will
             be performed with the CLIA-certified 68 gene Guardant360 panel (or equivalent) for
             select patients. This particular cohort of research collaboration will be supported
             by Guardant Health, Inc. at no charge to MD Anderson. Patients with adequate
             performance status (PS 0-1) who have active metastatic or inoperable locally advanced
             cancer or solid tumors and are being considered for enrollment into clinical trials
             in the next 2 lines of therapy will be enrolled. Additionally, patients whose
             original solid tumor block has been exhausted, deemed insufficient for testing by the
             Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory or is otherwise unavailable for testing may be
             enrolled.

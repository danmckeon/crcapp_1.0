  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if MEDI4736 will be adequately tolerated in
      combination with tremelimumab in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, and dose expansion study of MEDI4736 in
      combination with tremelimumab to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK),
      immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in adult
      subjects with advanced NSCLC.

    <measure>Objective response</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 24 weeks as compared to baseline</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 as defined as the best response among all overall responses recorded from the start of treatment until progression, or the last evaluable disease assessment in the absence of progressive disease (PD) prior to the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, or discontinuation from the study, whichever occurs first.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects experiencing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Depending upon the cohort, the DLT evaluation period is from the 1st dose of study medication until (1) the 3rd dose of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab (2) the 2nd dose of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab or (3) the 3rd dose of MEDI4736 and 2nd dose of tremelimumab</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD), which is the highest dose within a cohort where no more than 1 out of 6 subjects experience DLTs or the highest protocol-defined dose for each agent in the absence of exceeding the MTD, will be evaluated using the following safety assessments: adverse events, serious advents, laboratory evaluations, vital signs, physical examinations, and electrocardiogram (ECG) results. Measurements will be aggregated to determine whether a subject has experienced a DLT as assessed by the investigator.</description>

    <time_frame>During treatment through study completion, about 2 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Antitumor activity will include objective response (OR) and disease control (DC) based on RECIST Version 1.1, duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).</description>

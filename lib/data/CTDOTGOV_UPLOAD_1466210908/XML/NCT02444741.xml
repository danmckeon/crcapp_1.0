      The goal of Phase 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of
      the combination of Keytruda (pembrolizumab, also called MK-3475) and radiation therapy
      (either conventional or stereotactic body radiation therapy [SBRT]). The safety of this
      combination will also be studied.

      The goal of Phase 2 of this study is to learn if this combination therapy can help to
      control metastatic NSCLC.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 24 participants will be enrolled in Phase 1
      of the study, and up to 80 participants will be enrolled in Phase 2.

      Phase 1:

      If you are enrolled in Phase 1, the dose of pembrolizumab you receive will depend on when
      you join this study. The first set of participants will receive the lowest dose level of
      pembrolizumab. Each new set will receive a higher dose of pembrolizumab than the set before
      it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable
      dose of pembrolizumab is found.

      In addition to pembrolizumab, you will receive either SBRT or conventional radiation
      therapy, depending on what type of radiation therapy the doctor thinks will be better for
      you.

      Phase 2:

      If you are enrolled in Phase 2, you will receive pembrolizumab at the highest dose that was
      tolerated in Phase 1.

      If the doctor thinks SBRT would be better for you, you will be randomly assigned (as in the
      flip of a coin) to either Group 1 or Group 2, described below. If the doctor thinks
      conventional radiation therapy would be better for you, you will be randomly assigned to
      either Group 3 or Group 4 below. This is done because no one knows if one study group is
      better, the same, or worse than the other group. You will have an equal chance of being in
      either group.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive SBRT and pembrolizumab.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive pembrolizumab alone. However, if the disease
           has gotten worse after 5 weeks or possibly later, you may be able to also start
           receiving SBRT. °If your doctor thinks it would be safer, you may cross over to Group 4
           (described below) and receive conventional radiation therapy instead of SBRT.

        -  If you are in Group 3, you will receive conventional radiation therapy and
           pembrolizumab.

        -  If you are in Group 4, you will receive pembrolizumab alone. However, if the disease
           has gotten worse after 5 weeks or possibly later, you may be able to continue receiving
           pembrolizumab and start receiving conventional radiation therapy.

      Study Therapy Administration:

      You will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle.

      Radiation will consist of either 4 or 15 daily treatments lasting about 30-45 minutes each
      day while you stay in the same position. Depending on what group you are in and the status
      of the disease, you will either start radiation on the same day as your first pembrolizumab
      dose, or if the disease has gotten worse. The doctor will discuss the radiation therapy
      schedule with you.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of each cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      One (1) day before the start of Cycles 3, 5, 8, 11, and 14, you will have a CT, PET, MRI,
      x-ray, and/or ultrasound scan.

      Leftover tumor tissue from an earlier procedure will be used for biomarker testing.
      Biomarkers are found in the blood and tissue and may be related to your reaction to the
      study treatment.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive up to 16 cycles of pembrolizumab. You will receive up to 15 radiation
      treatments, depending on what group you are in. You will no longer be able to take the study
      drug if intolerable side effects occur or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      If the disease has gotten worse, you may be able to continue study therapy, as described
      above.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      About 30 days after your last dose of pembrolizumab:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a CT, PET, MRI, x-ray, and/or ultrasound scan.

        -  You may have lung function tests performed.

      About every 12 weeks for 2 years after you finish your last pembrolizumab cycle, the
      following tests and procedures may be performed. Instead of any of these follow-up visits,
      it is possible the study staff may call you instead and ask how you are doing.

        -  You may have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) may be collected for routine tests.

        -  You may have a CT, PET, MRI, x-ray and/or ultrasound scan.

      Starting 2 years after you finish your last pembrolizumab cycle, you will have a physical
      exam and/or a CT, PET, MRI, x-ray, and/or ultrasound scan every 12 weeks if your doctor
      thinks it is needed. If you have these procedures performed at another hospital, information
      about your medical history, physical exam, lung function, and scans will be sent to MD
      Anderson for review.

      This is an investigational study. Radiation therapy (both conventional and SBRT) is FDA
      approved for the local control of metastatic and primary tumors. Pembrolizumab is FDA
      approved and commercially available for the treatment of melanoma that is metastatic or
      cannot be removed by surgery. Its use in patients with metastatic NSCLC is investigational.

      Up to 104 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
             agent (except glutamine) or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the
             first dose of treatment or 5 half lives, which ever is shorter.

          2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of
             trial treatment. Unless the steroid therapy is for physiological replacement.

          3. Has a diagnosis of active scleroderma, lupus, or other autoimmune disease which by
             the opinion of the treating radiation oncologist precludes safe radiation therapy.

          4. Has had prior radiation therapy to all available thoracic and liver lesions such that
             additional radiation therapy is unsafe by the opinion of the treating radiation
             oncologist.

          5. Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives, which ever is
             shorter, prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., &lt;/= Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          6. Has had prior chemotherapy or targeted small molecule therapy within 2 weeks prior to
             study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., &lt;/= Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse
             events due to a previously administered agent. *Note: Subjects with &lt;/= Grade 2
             neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. **Note:

             provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least
             four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms
             have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases,

             interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         13. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

         14. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit

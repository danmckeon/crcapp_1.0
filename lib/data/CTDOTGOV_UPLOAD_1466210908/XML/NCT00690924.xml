      RATIONALE: Calcitriol may prevent lung cancer in patients with metaplasia or dysplasia of
      the lungs.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of calcitriol in
      preventing lung cancer in current smokers and former smokers at high risk of lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To establish the safety of calcitriol in patients at high risk of lung cancer.

        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicities of calcitriol in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral calcitriol on day 1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks for 3
      months in absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection periodically for pharmacokinetic and molecular analysis.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

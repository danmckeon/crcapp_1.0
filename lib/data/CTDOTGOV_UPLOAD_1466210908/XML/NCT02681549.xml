    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2 trial is to study the activity of pembrolizumab in combination
      with bevacizumab in patients with untreated brain metastases from melanoma or NSCLC to
      determine activity and safety of the drug combination. Furthermore, in patients who undergo
      resection of biopsy of a brain metastasis, we will evaluate biomarkers predictive of
      treatment benefit, and will also conduct correlative biomarker studies on extra-cerebral
      specimens in all patients in whom a systemic biopsy is feasible or in archival tumor tissue
      when available.

      A total of 53 eligible patients will be enrolled on this trial (20 with melanoma and 33 with
      NSCLC). Individual cohorts of the study can be stopped if insufficient activity is observed
      in the first stage of that cohort. The study will accrue for approximately 24 months, and
      will be open for approximately 12 additional months as patients on study are being followed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Biopsy proven metastatic melanoma or non-squamous NSCLC with at least one untreated
             cerebral metastasis that is at least 5 mm AND twice the MRI slice thickness, but less
             than Page 22 of 71 20 mm, that is asymptomatic and does not require local therapy at
             the time of enrollment (&quot;clinically evaluable lesion(s)&quot;).

          2. Age ≥18

          3. ECOG performance status &lt; 2

          4. Any number of previous treatments with the exception of previous inhibitors of PD-1,
             PD-L1, or PD-L2. Other prior systemic therapies must have been administered at least
             2 weeks before administration of pembrolizumab; the exception to this is ipilimumab
             which must have been administered at least 4 weeks prior to the start of
             pembrolizumab. Patients are not required to have had prior systemic therapy.

          5. Life expectancy of at least 3 months

          6. A history of previously treated brain metastases is allowed, provided that at least
             14 days have lapsed between radiation and initiation of pembrolizumab. Any lesion
             present at the time of WBRT or included in the stereotactic radiotherapy field (or
             within 2mm of the treated lesion) will NOT be considered evaluable unless it is new
             or documented to have progressed since treatment.

          7. PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue from any site is required for patients with NSCLC.
             Tumor tissue can be archival, however if no archival tissue is available then a
             biopsy mube obtained for PD-L1 testing. PD-L1 expression will be analyzed by a Merck
             assay. PD-L1 expression is not required for patients with melanoma, but melanoma
             patients are required to submit an extra-cerebral specimen for analysis, unless it is
             not feasible to obtain one.

          8. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function Exclusion Criteria:

          9. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

         10. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the
             course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication
             (Reference Section 5.7.2). Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not
             been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

         11. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study
             therapy. -

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Symptomatic brain metastases. Any neurologic symptoms present must have resolved
             withlocal therapy by the time of administration of study drug.

          2. Patients with brain metastases for whom complete surgical resection is clinically
             appropriate.

          3. Patients with lung cancer with squamous histology.

          4. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy to
             the lung or brain within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e.,
             ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.
             Previous radiation to other sites may be completed at any time prior to initiation of
             pembrolizumab. Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered
             adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to
             starting therapy.

             Note: Toxicity that has not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 is allowed if it meets the
             inclusion requirements for laboratory parameters.

          5. Has had prior treatment with any other anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 or PD-L2 agent.

          6. The use of corticosteroids to control cerebral edema or treat neurologic symptoms
             will not be allowed, and patients who previously required corticosteroids for symptom
             control must be off steroids for at least 2 weeks. Low-dose steroid use (≤10 mg of
             prednisone or equivalent) as corticosteroid replacement therapy is allowed

          7. Has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          8. Presence of leptomeningeal disease

          9. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2
             years (i.e.

             with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs).
             Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         10. Pregnancy or breast feeding. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab,
             breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated with pembrolizumab.

         11. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents and may not have
             participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

         12. Either a concurrent condition (including medical illness, such as active infection
             requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics or the presence of laboratory
             abnormalities) or history of a prior condition that places the patient at
             unacceptable risk if he/she were treated with the study drug or a medical condition
             that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.

         13. Concurrent, active malignancies in addition to those being studied (other than
             cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma)

         14. Patients with active hemoptysis.

         15. Any contraindication to MRI (i.e. patients with pacemakers or other metal implanted
             medical devices). An MRI safety questionnaire is required prior to MR imaging.

         16. Has active non-infectious pneumonitis

         17. Has a known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B (HBV), or Hepatitis C
             (HCV) infection.

         18. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

         19. Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg
             and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg). Anti-hypertensive therapy to achieve
             these parameters is allowable.

         20. History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 3 months prior to Cycle 1,
             Day 1

         21. History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 3 months prior to Cycle 1, Day
             1

         22. Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm requiring surgical repair or
             recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to Cycle 1, Day 1

         23. Evidence of bleeding diathesis or clinically significant coagulopathy (in the absence
             of therapeutic anticoagulation). Any history of significant bleeding or thrombosis
             should be discussed the study PIs.

         24. Current or recent (within 10 calendar days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1) use of
             dipyramidole, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, or cilostazol

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to improve lung cancer screening in high-risk individuals by
      identifying biomarkers of preclinical disease and disease risk that are measured in
      minimally invasive and non-invasive biospecimens. Existing biomarkers for lung cancer
      diagnosis as well as new biomarkers discovered specifically in this clinical setting will be
      examined. Biomarkers that identify individuals at highest risk for being diagnosed with lung
      cancer prior to the appearance of concerning symptoms could increase the utility of lung
      cancer surveillance and the efficiency of lung cancer chemoprevention clinical trials.
      Achieving these goals would improve the detection and treatment of early stage and incipient
      lung cancer, while restricting the risk of these procedures to those individuals who
      currently exhibit the early molecular warning signs of impending disease.

      The Detection of Early lung Cancer Among Military Personnel (DECAMP) consortium is a
      multidisciplinary and translational research program that includes 7 Veterans Administration
      Hospitals (VAH), the 4 designated Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) and three academic
      hospitals as clinical study sites, several molecular biomarker laboratories, along with
      Biostatics, Bioinformatics, Pathology and Biorepository cores. The DECAMP Coordinating
      Center will facilitate rapid selection, design and execution of clinical studies within this
      multi-institutional consortium. The ACRIN 4704 study will recruit two (2) cohorts to achieve
      the aims of this study: a cross-sectional early stage lung cancer cohort (Group A) and a
      longitudinal screening cohort (Group B).

    <description>The cross-sectional cohort (Group A) is an exploratory assessment group aimed at distinguishing patients with a history of smoking diagnosed with early stage lung cancer versus those with benign lung disease. We will recruit 80 patients undergoing resection surgery to Group A, with the intent of accruing 50 participants diagnosed with early stage lung cancer in order to compare them with 30 participants diagnosed with benign lung nodules who will act as a control cohort for this study.</description>

    <description>For this longitudinal screening cohort (Group B), we will enroll 800 participants who currently or historically smoked and who have a 10 year Bach risk model of lung cancer &gt; 2.5% (5). We will include participants 50 to 79 years old, with ≥10 cigarettes/day for current smokers, or ≥20 pack years for former smoker who quit 20 years ago or less. In order to further enrich for lung cancer risk, participants also will have COPD/emphysema or at least one first-degree relative with a diagnosis of lung cancer. We will exclude patients previously diagnosed with lung cancer. These patients will be followed for a total of 4 years with annual follow-up visits.</description>

        Group A: Inclusion Criteria for cross-sectional early stage lung cancer cohort

          -  Ages 50 to 79 years;

          -  Smoking status: Current or former smoker with ≥ 30 pack years (PKY) (pack years =
             number of packs per day X number of years smoked);

          -  Undergoing surgical resection;

          -  Willing to undergo pre-operative or peri-operative fiberoptic bronchoscopy;

          -  Able to tolerate all biospecimen collection as required by protocol;

          -  Able to comply with standard-of-care procedures until surgery (approximately three
             months);

          -  Willing to allow standard-of-care imaging taken prior to study enrollment to be
             submitted to ACRIN; Able to fill out Patient Lung History questionnaire;

          -  Willing and able to provide a written informed consent.

        Group B: Inclusion Criteria for longitudinal screening cohort

          -  Ages 50 to 79 years;

          -  Smoking status: Current or former smoker (≥10 cigarettes/day for current smokers, or
             ≥20 pack years for former smoker who quit 20 years ago or less)

             first-degree relative with a diagnosis of lung cancer;

          -  Willing to undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy;

          -  Able to tolerate all biospecimen collection as required by protocol;

          -  Able to comply with standard-of-care follow-up visits, including clinical exams,

          -  Able to fill out Patient Lung History questionnaire;

          -  Willing and able to provide a written informed consent.

             eligible for Group A if first lung cancer diagnosis has been recently confirmed by
             bronchoscopic biopsy and is leading to resection surgery, but not if this is not a
             first diagnosis);

          -  Contraindications to nasal brushing or fiberoptic bronchoscopy, including: ulcerative
             nasal disease, hemodynamic instability, severe obstructive airway disease (i.e.,

             pulmonary disease, as well as other comorbidities leading to inability to protect
             airway, or altered level of consciousness;

          -  Allergies to any local anesthetic that may be used to obtain biosamples in the study;

          -  Weight greater than that allowable by the CT scanner (GROUP B ONLY).

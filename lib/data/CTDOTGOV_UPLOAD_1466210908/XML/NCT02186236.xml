  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether gene mutations can be found in the urine or
      blood of lung cancer patients and urine of colorectal cancer patients. Gene mutations are
      when DNA in a gene is damaged in a way that changes the genetic message carried by that
      gene. Gene mutations can sometimes cause lung cancers. These gene mutations are only found
      in lung and colorectal cancer cells, not the normal cells in your body. All lung cancer
      tumors and colorectal cancer tumors are now tested for different gene mutations as their
      presence affects lung cancer treatment. Tumor samples obtained from a biopsy or surgery are
      typically tested for these gene mutations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Lung cancer:

        For patients participating in Part A (initial testing) and Part B (serial testing):

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of stage IV lung adenocarcinoma undergoing systemic
             therapy.

          -  Patients must have had or intend to have EGFR mutation testing (specifically
             including exon 19 deletions and L858R) performed on their tumor with results
             available from a CLIA certified laboratory.

          -  â‰¥ 18 years of age

        Specific to patients participating in Part B (serial testing):

          -  Patients must be planning to receive cancer care at Memorial-Sloan Kettering.

          -  Patients must have a confirmed EGFR mutant lung cancer (exon 19 deletions and L858R)
             with molecular testing results available from a CLIA certified laboratory.

          -  Must be within 3 months of their diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer.

          -  Treatment plan should include an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but may concurrently
             be on a therapeutic protocol.

        Colorectal Cancer:

        For patients participating in Part A (initial testing) and Part B (serial testing):

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of stage IV colorectal adenocarcinoma undergoing
             systemic therapy or have recently progressed on therapy including anti-EGFR based
             therapy.

          -  Patients must have had or intend to have RAS/RAF mutation testing on their tumor with
             results available from a CLIA certified laboratory. For the patients who recently
             progressed on anti-EGFR must have tumor tissue molecular analyses preformed (prior to
             enrolling or a plan to test it at the time of enrollment).

          -  &gt;18 years of age

        Specific to patients participating in Part B (serial testing):

          -  Patients must be planning to receive cancer care at Memorial-Sloan Kettering.

          -  Patients must have a confirmed RAS/RAF mutant colorectal cancer with molecular
             testing results available from a CLIA certified laboratory.

          -  Must be within 3 months of their diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        lung cancer and colorectal cancer

          -  Comorbidities that would prohibit or make serial urine collection difficult or
             impossible

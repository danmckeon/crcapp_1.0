  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the effects and safety of giving lithium carbonate (lithium)
      to patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) undergoing radiation therapy to the brain
      (PCI; prophylactic cranial irradiation). PCI is used to prevent cancer metastases from
      returning in the brain. This treatment can cause short-term memory problems by damaging the
      hippocampus. Lithium may help prevent or lessen memory problems caused by PCI by protecting
      the hippocampus.

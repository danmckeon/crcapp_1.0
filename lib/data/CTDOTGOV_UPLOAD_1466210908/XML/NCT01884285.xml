      This is a phase I, open-label, multicentre study of AZD8186 administered orally in patients
      with advanced castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), squamous non-small cell lung cancer
      (sqNSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and known PTEN-deficient/mutated or PIK3CB
      mutated/amplified advanced solid malignancies. The study design allows an escalation of dose
      with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients.

      There are 4 parts to this study: Part A, dose escalation, Part B, expansion cohort(s) in
      PTEN deficient patients at the intended therapeutic dose(s) and schedule(s), Part C, AZD8186
      in combination with abiraterone accetate (with prednisone) - dose/ schedule confirmation
      followed by expansion phase in PTEN-deficient mCRPC) and Part D, AZD8186 in combination with
      AZD2014 (a novel dual mTORC1/2 inibitor) dose/schedule finding followed by expansion phase
      in PTEN deficient TNBC.

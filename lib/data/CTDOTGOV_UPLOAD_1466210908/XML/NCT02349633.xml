      Phase 1: The Phase 1 study is an open label, multi center, multiple dose, non randomized,
      safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamics dose escalation study of PF 06747775 as a
      single agent in patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC (del19 or L858R, +/ -T790M).

      Phase 2: an open label, multi-center, single arm study of PF-06747775 for the assessment of
      anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced EGFRm (del19 or L858R) advanced NSCLC with
      T790M (del 19 and T790M or L858R and T790M) and further pharmacokinetic characterization.

        Inclusion criteria (partial list):

          -  Evidence of histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced
             or metastatic EGFRm (del19 or L858R) NSCLC that has progressed after at least 1 prior
             line of therapy.

        Patients must have at least on measurable lesion as defined by RECIST V1.1 that has not
        been previously irradiated

          -  Patients must have had disease progression on treatment with an approved EGFR TKI.

               -  In Phase 1, patients may have also received other lines of therapy before or
                  after the EGFR TKI.

               -  In Phase 2, while patients may have had multiple lines of therapy, the last

                  Sildenafil at MTD and Japan PK sub-studies). Please contact the Sponsor for
                  direction for any other EGFR TKI.

                  be starting on continuous PF-06747775 dosing directly (Phase 1 PK sub-studies at
                  RP2D except Japan).

          -  Concurrent use of drugs that are strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors (such as but
             not limited to: dronedarone, erythromycin, indinavir, indinavir/ritonavir,

             ritonavir, valspodar, verapamil, vorapaxar). Patients must avoid the use of drugs
             that are known strong P-gp inhibitors for the duration of the study. therapy with a

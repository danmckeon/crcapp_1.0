  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of LAG525 as a single agent and in combination
      with PDR001 to adult patients with solid tumors. The study consists of a dose escalation
      phase (I) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)
      for LAG525 as a single agent and in combination with PDR001, and a dose expansion phase (II)
      which will characterize treatment of LAG525 as a single agent and in combination with PDR001
      at the MTD or RP2D.

    <description>A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug, and unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first cycle of treatment with single agent LAG525 or within the first two cycles of treatment with the combination of LAG525 and PDR001</description>

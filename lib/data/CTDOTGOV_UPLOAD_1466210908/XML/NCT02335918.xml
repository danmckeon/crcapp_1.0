  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the clinical benefit (how well the drug works), safety, and
      tolerability of combining varlilumab and nivolumab (also known as BMS-936558). Both drugs
      target the immune system and may act to promote anti-cancer effects. The study will enroll
      patients with the following cancer types: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Melanoma, Colorectal,
      Ovarian or Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Renal Cell Carcinoma and Glioblastoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Varlilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called CD27 found
      on certain immune cells and may act to promote anti-tumor effects.

      Nivolumab is a full human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called PD-1 on immune
      cells and promotes anti-tumor effects.

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of anti-CD27 antibody
      varlilumab in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab.

      Eligible patients that enroll in the dose escalation portion of the study will be assigned
      to one of three dose levels of varlilumab in combination with 3 mg/kg of nivolumab. The
      first phase of the study will test the safety profile of the combination and determine which
      dose will be studied in Phase ll of the overall study.

      During Phase ll, six cohorts of 18-35 patients each (dependent on cancer type) will be
      enrolled and receive 3 mg/kg of varlilumab in combination with nivolumab at 240 mg.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is
      response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur.

    <description>During the treatment phase of the study, eligible patients will receive varlilumab for 3 cycles, with an option for a 4th cycle as determined by study doctors. Treatment cycles are eight weeks each with study drug administered once every two weeks. There is no limit on the number of cycles of nivolumab. Patients may be discontinued from receiving study treatment (nivolumab or varlilumab) based on the results of disease assessments or if experiencing side effects that make study therapy intolerable.
Phase I Dose: The planned dose of varlilumab will be dependent on the cohort assigned at enrollment. Varlilumab doses are 0.1 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg.
Phase II Dose: Patients enrolled in the Phase ll study phase will receive 3.0 mg/kg of varlilumab in combination with nivolumab at 240 mg every 2 weeks.</description>

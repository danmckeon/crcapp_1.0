  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of TAS-120 and determine the most
      appropriate dose for the subsequent phase 2 safety and efficacy study in patients with
      advanced solid tumors and multiple myeloma with genetic abnormalities.

      The progression of cancers is caused by a complex series of multiple genetic and molecular
      events leading to changes in the patients DNA. The fibroblast growth factor/fibroblast
      growth factor receptor (FGF/FGFR) signaling pathway is important for normal organ, vascular
      and skeletal development. However, FGFR gene abnormalities have been linked to various
      cancers.

      TAS-120 is a highly potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of FGFR and is therefore is
      being studied as a therapy for cancer.

      Background and rationale for study:

        -  Activating fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene abnormalities are reported in
           various cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (FGFR1 amplification),
           breast (FGFR1 and 2 amplification), gastric (FGFR2 amplification), bladder (FGFR3
           activating mutation or gene translocation), endometrial (FGFR2 activating mutation),
           multiple myeloma (FGFR3 gene translocation), and rhabdomyosarcoma (FGFR4-activating
           mutation).

        -  TAS-120 is a novel, highly potent and selective small molecule FGFR inhibitor.

      Phase 1 Dose Escalation:

      Primary

      • To investigate the safety and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAS-120 in patients with advanced solid tumors with or
      without FGF/FGFR abnormalities for whom no available therapy is likely to convey clinical
      benefit.

      Secondary

        -  To investigate the clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAS-120.

        -  To investigate the clinical pharmacodynamics of TAS-120.

        -  To determine any preliminary antitumor activity observed with TAS-120.

      Phase 1 Expansion and Phase 2:

      Primary •To investigate the efficacy of the TAS-120 RP2D in patients with advanced solid
      tumors or multiple myeloma, with FGF/FGFR abnormalities for whom no available therapy is
      likely to convey clinical benefit.

      Secondary

      •To investigate the safety of TAS-120.

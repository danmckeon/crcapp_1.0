    <textblock>
      Objectives:

      Our specific aims are to:

      Aim 1: Examine the feasibility of a couple-based meditation program in 50 patients with
      metastatic lung cancer and their partners.

      Aim 2: Establish the initial efficacy of a couple-based meditation program in patients and
      their partners regarding physical, psychological, and spiritual quality of life outcomes.

      Exploratory Aim: Explore potential intervention mediators (i.e., mindfulness, compassion,
      holding back, and intimacy) and a moderator (i.e., baseline distress) of the intervention
      effects.

      Phase 1:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, their demographic information (such as
      their age, sex, and race) will be recorded.

      Meditation and Discussion Program:

      Participant will take part in a meditation and discussion program. Two (2) times participant
      will meet with a mediation trained instructor. Participant should attend each session
      together as a couple.

      During the sessions, participant will do deep breathing and visualization exercises and then
      asked to review the exercises based on their experiences and what they prefer. Participant
      will also be asked for feedback about the instructions to make sure they were clear and easy
      to follow. Participant will also be asked to read written materials that are part of this
      program. Participant will be asked to complete a written review about the program in general
      and a questionnaire about their general health and well-being. Each session will last about
      60-90 minutes.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Patient's participation in this study will be over when they have completed the last session
      Phase 1.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 100 participant's and their partners (for a total of 200 participants) will take part
      in this study. This study has 3 phases to it: Phase 1 will include 15 couples (30
      participants), Phase 2 will include 10 couples (20 participants), and Phase 3 will include
      75 couples (150 participants). All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Phase 2:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, their demographic information (such as
      their age, sex, and race) will be recorded.

      Questionnaires:

      Participant will complete 12 questionnaires before their first meditation and discussion
      session. The questionnaires ask about participant's health, their mood, their level of
      fatigue, their sleeping habits, their relationship, and their quality of life. It should
      take about 45 minutes to complete these questionnaires.

      After completing the last session, about 4 weeks later, participant will be asked to
      complete the same questionnaires again. Additionally, participant will be asked to complete
      a program review asking them what they liked and did not like about the program.

      If participant cannot complete the questionnaires in the clinic, they will be given a
      self-addressed postage-paid envelope so that they can mail the questionnaires back to the
      study staff. Participant should try to finish and mail back the questionnaires no more than
      7 days after they begin filling them out.

      Meditation and Discussion Program:

      Participant will take part in a meditation and discussion program. Each week for 4 weeks,
      participant will have a meditation class with a trained meditation instructor. Participant
      will attend up to 4 sessions. Participant should attend each session together as a couple.

      During the meditation sessions, participant will do deep breathing and visualization
      exercises. Participant will discuss their experiences and observations afterwards with their
      partner and instructor. Each session will last about 60 minutes total.

      Participant will be asked to continue daily meditation practice and some other short
      exercises at home outside of the classes. Participant will receive a compact disc and
      printed materials to help with their home practice.

      The study staff will call participant 2 times per week over the 4-week period to remind them
      to practice their meditation. Participant will also be asked about any problems they may be
      having completing their practice. Each call should last about 10-15 minutes.

      All meditation and discussion sessions will be videotaped. This is so the researchers can
      keep track of the quality of the sessions. The video files are digital and will be deleted
      after all the data are studied.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Patient's participation in this study will be over when they have completed the
      questionnaires within 1 week after their last session. Patient's total participation length
      for Phase 2 is about 4-6 weeks.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 100 participants and their partners (for a total of 200 participants) will take part
      in this study. This study has 3 phases to it: Phase 1 will include 15 couples (30
      participants),Phase 2 will include 10 couples (20 participants), and Phase 3 will include 75
      couples (150 participants). All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Phase 3:

      If participant agrees to take part, their medical history and demographic information (such
      as their age, sex, and race) will be recorded. By signing this consent, participant also
      agrees that their partner will be asked to take part in this study.

      Participant will complete 13 questionnaires at the beginning of this study. The
      questionnaires ask about participant's health, any symptoms they may be having, their mood,
      their level of fatigue, their sleeping habits, their relationship, and their quality of
      life. It should take about 45 minutes to complete these questionnaires.

      If participant cannot complete the questionnaires in the clinic, they will be given a
      self-addressed postage-paid envelope so that they can mail the questionnaires back to the
      study staff. Participant should try to finish and mail back the questionnaires no more than
      7 days after they begin filling them out.

      Study Groups:

      Participant will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 3 groups. This is
      done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other
      group:

        -  If participant is in Group 1, they will take part in a couple-based meditation and
           discussion program.

        -  If participant is in Group 2, they will take part in a couple-based cancer-related
           discussion program.

        -  If participant is in Group 3, they will not take part in the couple-based meditation or
           cancer-related discussion program but will complete the same questionnaires as Group 1
           and 2. Participant will be given the option to take part in the couple-based mediation
           and discussion program (off study) after the other groups finish their last
           questionnaire packet.

      The group assignment is based on other factors such as participant's age and gender.

      Meditation and Discussion Program for Group 1:

      If participant is in Group 1, they will take part in a meditation and discussion program.
      Each week for 4 weeks, participant will have a meditation class with a trained meditation
      instructor. Participant should attend each session together as a couple.

      During the meditation sessions, participant will do deep breathing and visualization
      exercises. Participant will discuss their experiences and observations afterwards and engage
      in structured discussion with their partner and interventionist. Each session will last
      about 60 minutes total.

      Participant will be asked to continue daily meditation practice and some other short
      exercises at home outside of the classes. Participant will receive a compact disc and
      printed materials to help with their home practice.

      The study staff will call participant 2 times per week over the 4-week period to remind them
      to practice their meditation. Participant will also be asked about any problems they are
      having completing their practice. Each call should last about 10-15 minutes.

      Cancer-Related Discussion Program for Group 2:

      If participant is in Group 2, they will take part in a discussion program. Participant will
      have 1 discussion session each week for 4 weeks with a trained interventionist. These will
      be one-on-one sessions.

      During the discussion sessions, participant will discuss issues for couples coping with
      cancer.

      Each session will last about 60 minutes.

      For Groups 1 and 2:

      All meditation and discussion sessions will be videotaped. This is so the researchers can
      keep track of the quality of the sessions. The video files are digital and will be deleted
      after all the data are studied.

      All Groups:

      Participant will complete the same questionnaires they completed at the beginning of the
      study, 4 weeks later, and again 3 months later.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Patient's participation on this study will be over when they have completed the
      questionnaires at 3 months after their last session for Phase 3.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 100 participants and their partners (for a total of 200 participants) will take part
      in this study. This study has 3 phases to it: Phase 1 will include 15 couples (30
      participants), Phase 2 will include 10 couples (20 participants), and Phase 3 will include
      75 couples (150 participants). All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

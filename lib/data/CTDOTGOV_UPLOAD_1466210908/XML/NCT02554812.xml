  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2 dose-optimization study to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of avelumab (MSB0010718C) in
      combination with other cancer immunotherapies in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors. The primary purpose is to assess the safety and early signs of
      efficacy of various avelumab combinations with other cancer immunotherapies, optimizing
      dosing regimens as appropriate, in a limited series of indications.

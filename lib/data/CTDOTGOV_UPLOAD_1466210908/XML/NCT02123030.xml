  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of a microfabricated silicon device to concentrate ultra trace volatile organic
      compounds (VOCs) in human exhaled breath for quantitative analysis of VOCs.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Will use Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry (FT-MS) and Gas Chromatography-Mass
      Spectrometry (GC-MS) to analyze concentrated VOCs. The purpose of this study is to search
      for disease-related markers in the breath in subjects with known or suspected lung or other
      cancer, or pulmonary disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For controlled (healthy) subjects - we are seeking persons who do not have a known
             history of cancer or pulmonary disease.

          -  Both smokers and nonsmokers are invited to participate as control subjects.

          -  For experimental subjects, we are seeking persons with pulmonary disease but no known
             history of cancer, as identified by the investigators during routine clinic or office
             visits.

          -  Additionally for experimental subjects, we are seeking persons with known or
             suspected lung or other cancers, as identified by the investigators during routine
             clinic or office visits.

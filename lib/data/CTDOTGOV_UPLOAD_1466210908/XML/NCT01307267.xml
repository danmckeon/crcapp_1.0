        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Portion A: Histological or cytological diagnosis of advanced/metastatic solid tumor
             malignancy or B cell lymphoma, for which no curative therapy is available. Portion A
             expansion includes patients who have documented disease progression on a checkpoint
             inhibitor (anti CTLA 4, anti PD1/PD L1 antibodies) per RECIST criteria. Tumor types
             include metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), non-small cell lung cancer
             (NCSLC) and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Patients in the
             dose expansion stage are required to provide archival or baseline (obtained during
             the screening period) tumor biopsies.

          -  Portion B: Histological confirmed relapsed or refractory CD20 positive NHL for which
             no curative therapy is available. Patients enrolled in the expansion cohort must have
             archival tissue available, sampled within 6 months of study entry. The Expansion
             cohort includes patients with FL or DLBCL with relapsed or refractory disease.

          -  Measurable disease with at least one extranodal tumor mass &gt;1.0 cm in the greatest
             transverse diameter (GTD) or in the case of malignant lymph nodes &gt;1.5 cm in the GTD.

          -  ECOG performance status of ≤ 1.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function, for Portion A: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x
             109/L, platelet count ≥100 x 109/L, hemoglobin &gt;9.0 g/dL. For Portion B: ANC ≥ 1.0 x
             109/L, platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L, and hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL. In both cases,
             patients must be transfusion independent at least 14 days prior to screening.

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 2 x ULN or estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min.

          -  Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless the patient has documented Gilbert syndrome
             and AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids.

          -  Prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

          -  Immunosuppressive regimens involving systemic corticosteroids within 14 days before
             the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Therapeutic or experimental monoclonal antibodies within 28 day or prior radiation
             therapy within 14 days of the first dose of study drug.

          -  Autoimmune disorders and other diseases that compromise or impair the immune system.

          -  Unstable or serious concurrent medical conditions in the previous 6 months.

          -  Prior therapy with any anti CD137 monoclonal antibody.

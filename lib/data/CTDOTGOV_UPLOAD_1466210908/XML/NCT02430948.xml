  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that clearer visual presentation of guideline recommendations and
      educational outreach, or academic detailing, can improve guideline compliance. However, it
      will investigate other aspects of screening-related decision-making, such as provider and
      patient beliefs about screening, provider-patient communication and patient's willingness to
      forgo expected testing. The research question is whether educational interventions can
      decrease non-compliance with screening guidelines for 5 common cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cluster randomized trial that compares the immediate post-encounter
      impressions of 12 physicians and 18 of their patients about the discussion of screening for
      breast, cervical, colorectal, lung and prostate cancer as well as their beliefs about
      screening efficacy and patient reports of the screening experience. The interventions are
      educational materials and academic detailing (educational outreach) for providers. The
      investigators are particularly interested in contrasting the patient and provider
      recollections, the differential impact on underuse and overuse compliance and whether
      patient behaviors are consistent with their stated screening plans.

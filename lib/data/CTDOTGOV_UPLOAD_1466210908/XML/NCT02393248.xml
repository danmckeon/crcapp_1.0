    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacological
      activity of INCB054828 in subjects with advanced malignancies. This study will have three
      parts, dose escalation (Part 1), dose expansion (Part 2) and combination therapy (Part 3).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Treatment with other investigational study drug for any indication for any reason, or
             receipt of anticancer medications within 21 days or 5 half-lives before first dose of
             study drug

          2. Prior receipt of a selective FGFR inhibitor

          3. History of a calcium/phosphate homeostasis disorder

          4. History and/or current evidence of ectopic mineralization/calcification

          5. Current evidence of corneal disorder/keratopathy

          6. Has a history or presence of inadequate liver, renal, hematopoietic and/or cardiac
             function parameters outside protocol-defined range

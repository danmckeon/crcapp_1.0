  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a pilot feasibility study of single agent erlotinib in
      patients with metastatic EGFR mutant adenocarcinoma of the lung with up to one prior
      treatment with the sole purpose of characterizing the genomic landscape before erlotinib and
      at the time of disease progression. The logistics of obtaining adequate quality fresh tissue
      specimens for sequencing studies before therapy and at the time of disease progression in
      patients with advanced lung cancer are complex and a thorough understanding of the practical
      challenges in conducting a study like this is crucial.

      The current proposal will include exome and transcriptome sequencing from blood collected at
      baseline along with tumor samples obtained prior to starting erlotinib and at the time of
      disease progression (a total of two tissue samples and one blood sample per patient). If
      carried out successfully, the proposed strategy very likely will lead to a larger and
      adequately powered study to understand fully evolving molecular changes due to clonal
      selection under treatment pressure. The pace of progress in the field of sequencing
      technology currently underway is only likely to accelerate in the near future yielding
      richer and highly content-rich information. Moreover, it is likely that genomic information
      from DNA sequencing and transcriptome will be supplemented by analyses of translatomes and
      proteomes.

      The investigators plan to sequence paired tumor specimens from 20 patients with EGFR mutant
      adenocarcinoma of the lung before treatment with erlotinib and at the time of disease
      progression following treatment with erlotinib. As the investigators expect some drop off
      (due to unexpected clinical events precluding a second biopsy at the time of disease
      progression, poor specimen quality and early discontinuation of therapy for
      non-progression), the investigators will enroll 40 patients in this trial to get 20-paired
      specimens.

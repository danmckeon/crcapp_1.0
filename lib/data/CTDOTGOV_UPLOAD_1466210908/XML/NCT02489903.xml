  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to explore the potential of the epigenetic agent RRx-001 to sensitize
      small cell and non-small cell lung cancer and high grade neuroendocrine tumor patients who
      previously responded and now have failed a platinum based doublet to the previously
      effective therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, three-arm, three stage, pilot study for co-administration of RRx-001
      with autologous blood once weekly until progression followed by reintroduction of
      platinum-based doublet therapy.

      The study is designed to explore the potential of the epigenetic agent RRx-001 to sensitize
      patients who previously responded and now have failed a platinum based doublet.

      In the first stage of the study three (3) subjects with SCLC, NSCLC and HGNEC in each arm
      will receive RRx-001 until progression or intolerable toxicity at which point
      cisplatin/carboplatin plus albumin (nab-paclitaxel or Abraxane) in NSCLC and
      cisplatin/carboplatin plus etoposide in SCLC and extrapulmonary neuroendocrine tumors will
      be introduced or reintroduced. The first three patients will enrolled for safety and
      assessment for unacceptable toxicity. Each cohort will initially enroll 3 patients to assess
      for safety. If one of the 3 patients enrolled has an unexpected Adverse Events, then this
      combination would be considered unacceptable and the cohort would be stopped. If no
      unexpected AE occur then an additional 7 patients will be enrolled, a total of 10 patients
      per cohort. Each cohort will undergo a temporary pause after 10 patients are enrolled to
      assess safety and efficacy. If greater than 1/3 of patients (4 patients) have unexpected AE,
      then this cohort will be stopped for unacceptable toxicities. If at the completion
      enrollment of 10 subjects, at least 1 will need to have stable disease or better. If any arm
      has 1/10 subjects that has stable disease or better, then additional patients would be
      enrolled in this arm. Total patients that can be enrolled are 31 patients with NSCLC, 26
      patients with SCLC, and 26 patients with High Grade Neuroendocrine.

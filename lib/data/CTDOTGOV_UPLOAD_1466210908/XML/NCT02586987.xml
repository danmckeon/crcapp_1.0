      This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-centre, drug combination study of oral selumetinib plus
      intravenous MEDI4736 in patients with advanced solid tumours refractory to standard therapy
      or for which no standard therapy exists. The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      preliminary anti-tumour activity of ascending doses of selumetinib in combination with
      MEDI4736 will be investigated

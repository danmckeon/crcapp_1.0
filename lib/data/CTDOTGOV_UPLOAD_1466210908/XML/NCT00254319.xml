  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Avastin is a novel antiangiogenic agent that has recently been shown to improve response
      rates and survival of patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer when
      added to front-line carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy, and is now being routinely
      incorporated into the treatment of these patients. Alimta is a recently approved
      chemotherapeutic that has shown activity against non-small cell lung cancer when given alone
      and in combination with carboplatin, has a favorable toxicity profile andrequires only a
      brief (10 minute) infusion time. Therefore we propose to study the combination of Avasin,
      Alimta, and Carboplatin administered as front-line therapy to patients with advanced
      nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.

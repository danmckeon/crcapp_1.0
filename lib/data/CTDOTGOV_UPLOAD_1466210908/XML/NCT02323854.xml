  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post market prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multicenter study, designed to
      demonstrate dose response of an ablation system using a percutaneous approach in patients
      with primary, metastatic, or recurrent primary lung tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Endpoint: Dose response as indicated by CT imaging, measurement of maximum diameter
      and volume.

      Secondary Endpoint: Assessment of complete tumor ablation immediately post-procedure.

             resection of the tumor targeted for ablation.

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with all aspects of the treatment and
             evaluation schedule.

          -  ≥1 cm of tumor-free lung parenchyma between target tumor and pleura or fissure.

          -  Contraindicated for surgery.

          -  Prolonged chest infection, defined as lung consolidation that requires
             hospitalization and greater than 10 days of antibiotics 30 days prior to surgery.

          -  Tumor abutting main stem bronchus, main pulmonary artery branches, esophagus and/or
             trachea.

          -  Tumor with pleural contact.

          -  Tumors located &lt; 3 cm of staple lines or other metal objects.

             standard practices) or is actively breast-feeding.

          -  Subject has participated in an investigational drug or device research study within
             30 days of enrollment that would interfere with this study.

          -  The investigator determines that participation in the study may jeopardize the safety
             or welfare of the subject.

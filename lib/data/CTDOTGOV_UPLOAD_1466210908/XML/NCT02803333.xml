  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Moffitt Cancer Center and PatientsLikeMe.com (PLM), an online patient community, are
      working together to better understand the patient's entire lung cancer experience, both
      inside and outside the doctor's office. By combining the data that is captured by their care
      team in the clinic with the data participants enter at their home on PatientsLikeMe.com, the
      investigators hope to improve patient-physician treatment decisions, so that the patient's
      personal treatment goals and quality of life have the highest chances of being fulfilled.

    <description>Clinical, molecular, and patient-reported data will be collected from participants. Participants will be asked if their treatment course has changed and, if so, what changes have occurred. These questions are primarily meant to identify the number of patients who were switched from one treatment regimen (e.g., chemotherapy) to either PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitor treatment (immunotherapy) or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).</description>

             receiving any other treatments will be tracked for treatment outcomes, as well as to
             serve as comparison participants during data analyses of outcomes associated with
             PD-1/PDL-1 or EGFR-TKI).

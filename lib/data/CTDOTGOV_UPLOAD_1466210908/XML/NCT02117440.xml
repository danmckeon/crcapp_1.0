    <textblock>
      This study is designed to apply functional imaging, Fluorodeoxyglucose_Positron Emission
      Tomography (FDG-PET) and Ventilation/Perfusion Single Photon Emission Computerized
      Tomography (V/Q SPECT), before treatment and then again during treatment to see if it
      predicts how well the treatment works for your cancer and how well your lungs function
      during treatment. A Computerized Tomography (CT) will also be performed along with both of
      these procedures to help the researchers see clearly where your cancer or your healthy lung
      is located. The researchers also perform blood tests in this study to look for markers in
      your blood to see if it helps them determine your risk of developing side effects from
      radiation to the lungs. The researchers hope that this study will help them in the future to
      design radiation treatment plans that provide the best treatment for each individual
      patient.

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Although surgery
      provides the best chance of cure, the majority of lung cancers require radiation for
      treatment. The current radiation recommendation, using modern techniques and a uniform dose
      of prescription, generates an overall cure rate of less than 10-15%, and moderate toxicity
      in 10-30% of treated patients. Who can be cured and who will develop side effects? Computed
      tomography (CT) is a useful monitoring tool, but has limited power to predict both tumor
      control and lung toxicity. Using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
      (FDG-PET) and ventilation/perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (V/Q SPECT),
      we have recently shown heterogeneous changes in tumor activity and regional lung function
      during the course of radiation, which may be associated with long-term outcome. Data have
      also shown that radiation up-regulates the expression of cytokines, such as transforming
      growth factor beta 1 (TGFÃŸ1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). We hypothesize that radiation-induced
      functional changes and plasma cytokines are associated with long-term tumor control and
      radiation lung damage. The general strategy of this protocol is to perform functional
      imaging and blood testing during the course of radiation and correlate the results with
      long-term outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             positive FDG-PET

          -  AJCC Stage I to IV lung cancer requiring radiation therapy (3D conformal or
             stereotactic) with or without chemotherapy, palliative radiation needing dose up to
             36 to 50 Gy, with or without surgery. Stage IV disease is eligible only if the

             required for this protocol (pre-treatment, during RT, and throughout follow up
             period).

          -  Patients must sign an informed consent form for study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Malignant pleural or pericardial effusion.

          -  Pregnancy

      This study will examine bacteria and toxins in the mouth, lung and digestive system that may
      be the cause of various diseases or symptoms. H. pylori is a bacterium that produces various
      toxins that may contribute to lung problems. This study will examine specimens collected
      from the mouth, teeth, lung, digestive tract and blood to measure H. pylori and its toxins
      and their effects on cells.

      People 18 years of age and older with or without gastrointestinal disease may be eligible
      for this study. These include people without a history of lung disease as well as patients
      with any of the following: lymphangioleiomyomatosis, asthma, sarcoidosis, other chronic or
      genetic lung disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis or
      eosinophilic granuloma).

      Participants may undergo the following tests:

        -  Blood and urine tests, chest x-ray.

        -  Measurement of arterial blood gases: A small needle is placed in an artery in the
           forearm to collect arterial blood.

        -  Lung function tests: Subjects breathe deeply and occasionally hold their breath. They
           may also receive a medication that expands the airways.

        -  Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with lavage and bronchial brushing: The subject's mouth and
           throat are numbed with lidocaine; a sedative may be given for comfort. A thin flexible
           tube called a bronchoscope is advanced through the nose or mouth into the lung airways
           to examine the airways. Saline (salt water) is then injected through the bronchoscope
           into the air passage and then removed by gentle suction. Next, a small brush is passed
           through the bronchoscope and an area of the airway is brushed to collect some cells for
           examination.

        -  Mouth rinsing or teeth brushing to collect cells.

        -  Endoscopy: A small needle and catheter (thin plastic tube) are placed into an arm vein
           to administer fluids and medications through the vein. A sedative may be given. The
           throat is numbed with lidocaine and a thin flexible tube called an endoscope is
           inserted through the mouth and down the esophagus into the stomach and upper part of
           the small intestine to examine those areas.

      Vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA toxin), an 88-kDa multifunctional protein, and other toxins
      are produced by Helicobacter pylori. We hypothesize that H. pylori, VacA toxin, and other
      toxins within the gastrointestinal tract and/or oropharynx are also found in the lung and
      may contribute to decline in lung function. Analyses of gastrointestinal, oropharyngeal,
      lung and blood specimens will improve the understanding of H. pylori, VacA toxin, and other
      toxins as well as their potential role in pathophysiology of disease. The objectives of this
      exploratory protocol are to procure gastrointestinal, oropharyngeal, lung and/or blood
      specimens from healthy research volunteers and subjects with lung disease (e.g.,
      lymphangioleiomyomatosis, asthma, sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis) and to analyze these
      specimens for H. pylori, VacA toxin, and other toxins. We hypothesize that the toxins may
      have a role in the pathogenesis of lung disease and in the subclinical decline in lung
      function seen with aging.

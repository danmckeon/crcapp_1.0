  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This survey study is looking to determine if patient reported outcomes(using the PROMIS
      survey) will vary according to the presence of recurrent or metastatic lung or esophageal
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A patient-centered approach to lung cancer surveillance following resection needs to
      incorporate patient reported outcomes. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
      System (PROMIS®) was designed to revolutionize the assessment of patient reported outcomes
      by establishing a national resource for the measurement of patient-reported symptoms and
      other health outcomes.

      The PROMIS Assessment Center, the management tool within the larger PROMIS system, will be
      used to securely store de identified data, provide automated accrual reports and data export
      for this specific study. This study will have it's own study specific website.

      Patients seen at the University of Virginia Cancer Center will be identified and invited to
      participate in an assessment of their reported outcomes over multiple domains available in
      PROMIS. Collecting this information on lung cancer survivors may provide a robust platform
      to design a patient-centered surveillance strategy following resection.

      The study team hypothesizes that patient reported outcomes will vary according to the
      presence of recurrence or metastasis of lung or esophageal cancer. The study team also
      believes including patient reported outcomes into routine post-treatment surveillance will
      improve patient satisfaction and improve outcomes.

    <description>Enrolled subjects with lung or esophageal cancer will be asked to complete an on-line (web-based) survey (PROMIS) using a computer. This survey is estimated to take 10-15 min. Most patients will only be asked to complete this survey once, but some patients will be asked to answer the questions a second or third time over a maximum five year period. The scores will be compared to patients clinical state at the time the survey is completed. To help understand if Promis Scores can reflect clinical condition.</description>

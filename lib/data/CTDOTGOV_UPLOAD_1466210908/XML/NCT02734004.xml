  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness, safety, and antitumor activity of
      study drugs MEDI4736 in combination with olaparib. It will also examine what happens to the
      study drugs in the body and investigate how well the combination between MEDI4736 and
      olaparib is tolerated.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and antitumor activity of MEDI4736 in combination with olaparib in
      patients with advanced solid tumors, selected based on a rationale for response to olaparib.

      Patients will be poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-inhibitor and
      immunotherapy (IMT)-na√Øve (defined as no prior exposure to PARP inhibitors or IMT,
      including, but not limited to, other anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4
      [CTLA-4], anti-programmed cell death 1 [PD-1], anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]
      monoclonal antibodies, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell
      co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways).

      Initially, patients will be enrolled concurrently into 4 exploratory cohorts, which will
      include patients with relapsed Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), Germline mutated breast cancer
      susceptibility gene (gBRCAm) metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2)-negative breast cancer, gBRCAm platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, and Ataxia
      telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-negative gastric cancer. Additional tumor types may be added at
      a later date based on emerging data. The results from this study will form decision-making
      for future studies.

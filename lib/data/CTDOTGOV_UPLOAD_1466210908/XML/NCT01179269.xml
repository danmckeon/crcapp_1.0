  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response rate of pazopanib in combination with
      paclitaxel for untreated NSCLC patients who are not eligible for front-line therapy with a
      platinum doublet. This is not a minority population as the average age at diagnosis for
      NSCLC approximates 70. The elderly have been largely under-represented in many of the phase
      III NSCLC chemotherapy trials. Furthermore, the treatment of patients with performance
      status 2 remains controversial as they may be less likely to benefit and more likely to
      experience toxicity from a platinum doublet. This population has been excluded from many of
      the phase III combination chemotherapy protocols. The taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel)
      have demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. There is
      limited data combining an anti-angiogenesis agent with chemotherapy in the elderly and PS 2
      population. By inhibiting VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-kit, pazopanib may stop or slow the rate of
      tumor growth and development. The combination of the two agents with minimal overlapping
      toxicity may afford additive anti-tumor effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of Stage IIIB (with confirmed
             malignant pleural effusion) or Stage IV NSCLC.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2

          -  No prior systemic first-line therapy for Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC with chemotherapy or any
             other biologic therapy. Prior surgery and/or localized irradiation for NSCLC are
             permitted. Palliative radiation therapy must have ended 14 days prior to first dose
             of pazopanib. Subject with recurrence after previous NSCLC that has been treated with
             surgery with or without adjuvant chemotherapy/radiation for curative intent are
             eligible, provided 12 months have passed since this treatment ended.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Appropriate for doublet therapy as first line therapy. At discretion of investigator.

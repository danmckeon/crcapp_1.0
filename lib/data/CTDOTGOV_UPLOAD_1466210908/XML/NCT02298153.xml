    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of epacadostat (INCB024360)
      administered in combination with atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) in patients with locally advanced
      or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that have been previously treated with
      platinum-based chemotherapy. The study will be conducted in two phases. The dose escalation
      phase will utilize a 3 + 3 design to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or a
      Pharmacologically Active Dose (PAD) of the combination. This will be followed by a dose
      expansion phase, which will be comprised of two cohorts. Expansion Cohort 1 will further
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics at
      the dose identified in phase one. Expansion Cohort 2 will evaluate the change in biomarker
      expression following treatment with INCB024360 as monotherapy followed by epacadostat
      (INCB024360) and atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) administered in combination.

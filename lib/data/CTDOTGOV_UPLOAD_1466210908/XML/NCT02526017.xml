        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have at least one measurable lesion at baseline by computed tomography
             (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as per RECIST v1.1 criteria.

          -  Patients must have had progressive disease on, after, or refused, appropriate
             approved therapy for their tumor type.

          -  Understand and sign an IRB/IEC-approved ICF prior to any study-specific evaluation

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Willing and able to comply with all study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or history of clinically significant muscle disorders (e.g., myositis),
             recent unresolved muscle injury, or any condition known to elevate serum CK levels

          -  Decreased cardiac function with NYHA &gt; Class 2

          -  Uncontrolled or significant heart disorder such as unstable angina

          -  Significant abnormalities on ECG at screening. QTcF &gt;450 msec for males or &gt;470 msec
             for females at screening

          -  History of anti-drug antibodies, severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other
             infusion-related reaction to a previous biologic agent

          -  Positive test for latent tuberculosis (TB) at screening (Quantiferon test) or
             evidence of active TB

          -  Patients with abnormal serum chemistry values, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator is considered to be clinically significant, will be excluded from the
             study

          -  Lack of peripheral venous or central venous access or any condition that would
             interfere with drug administration or collection of study samples

          -  Any uncontrolled medical condition or psychiatric disorder which, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, would pose a risk to patient safety or interfere with study
             participation or interpretation of individual patient results

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Current unresolved infection or history of chronic, active, clinically significant
             infection (viral, bacterial, fungal, or other) which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would preclude the patient from exposure to a biologic agent or pose a
             risk to patient safety

          -  Prior exposure to any CSF1R pathway inhibitors

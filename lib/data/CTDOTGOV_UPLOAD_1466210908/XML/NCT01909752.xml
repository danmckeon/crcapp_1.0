  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test an investigational vaccine, called DRibbles, for the treatment of
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We hypothesize that vaccination with the DRibble vaccine
      will cause an immune responses against proteins contained in the DRibble vaccine and the
      protein antigens targeted by this strong immune response will include common antigens shared
      by both the vaccine and the patient's tumor.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized study in which the first 33 patients will be assigned to
      receive the either:

        -  DRibbles vaccine and HPV vaccine

        -  DRibbles vaccine, HPV vaccine, and imiquimod

        -  DRibbles vaccine, HPV vaccine, and GM-CSF After 11 patients have been assigned to each
           group, the study arm with the greatest number of vaccine-induced strong antibody
           responses will then continue with enrollment of 15 further patients. The primary
           objective is to determine the best strategy to induce strong (&gt;15 fold) tumor-specific
           or tumor-associated antibody responses in patients with stage III A and B NSCLC. The
           goal is to select one regimen to advance to additional clinical trials.

    <description>To evaluate the overall safety of allogeneic NSCLC DRibble vaccine alone or in combination with either imiquimod or GM-CSF, as adjuvant treatment for definitively-treated patients with Stage IIIA or B NSCLC. During the treatment period, patients will be seen in clinic 13 times over a 22-week period; performance status and side-effects will be evaluated at each visit.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Evaluate progression-free survival. Tumor measurements by CT scan will be obtained at week 16 and subsequently at the discretion of the treating investigator. After the treatment period, patients will be seen every 3 months for 2 years, or until progressive disease.</description>

    <description>Evaluate whether any immune response data correlate with progression-free survival. Immune response data will be collected 12 times over the first 43 weeks and then every 3 months until two years or progressive disease. This data will be correlated with progression-free survival.</description>

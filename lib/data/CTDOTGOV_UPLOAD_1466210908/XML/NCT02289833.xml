  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm, two cohort study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine as single-agent in patients with HER2-positive
      locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients will be enrolled
      into two separate cohorts, depending on HER2 status: HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 2+ or
      HER2 IHC 3+. Patients in both cohorts will be treated with an intravenous dose of 3.6 mg/kg
      trastuzumab emtansine on Day 1 of 21-day cycles. Patients will remain on study until disease
      progression (as assessed by the investigator), unmanageable toxicity, or study termination
      by the Sponsor.

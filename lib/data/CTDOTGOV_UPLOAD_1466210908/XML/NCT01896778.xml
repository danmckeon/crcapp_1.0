  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies body warming in improving blood flow and oxygen
      delivery to tumors in patients with cancer. Heating tumor cells to several degrees above
      normal body temperature may kill tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility and efficacy of 2 different Body Warming to Alter (Thermo)
      Regulation and the Microenvironment (B-WARM) regimens on altering tumor blood flow in
      patients with a variety of malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if duration and thermal dose of B-WARM changes duration and extent of tumor
      blood flow changes in patients with a variety of malignancies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo B-WARM at 39 degrees Celsius (C) for 30 minutes.

      ARM II: Patients undergo B-WARM at 39 degrees C for 2 hours.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 30 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a variety of malignancies (i.e., melanoma, sarcoma, colon, head and
             neck, renal, breast, lung, ovary, liver)

          -  Patients must have measurable disease (1.0 cm or greater) by computed tomography (CT)
             scan

          -  Have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (using the Cockcroft-Gault
             equation) of more than 60 mL/min

          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2

                  date of B-WARM therapy

          -  Patients should not have either CT scanning or B-WARM if they have a fever at the
             time

               -  Fever should be worked up and treated as appropriate

               -  Patients should be afebrile for 24 hours prior to scanning or B-WARM therapy

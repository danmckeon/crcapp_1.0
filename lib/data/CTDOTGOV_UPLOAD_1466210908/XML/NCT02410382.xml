  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at how dexamethasone and placebo influence radiation fatigue, quality
      of life and number of treatment days missed during radiation therapy or radiation therapy
      and chemotherapy for cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will randomly receive either dexamethasone or placebo and begin the study
      medication during the midpoint of their radiation treatment. Study medication will be taken
      for 14 straight days then stopped. Fatigue and quality of life will be measured weekly with
      short patient completed surveys. The number of breaks taken during radiation treatment will
      also be tracked. For safety, blood sugar levels will be checked with finger stick blood
      draws because dexamethasone is known to cause these levels to increase. Study participation
      will be approximately 3 months.

      Eligible lung cancer patients: Undergo pre-treatment 4D-CT study for treatment planning

      External Beam Radiation: standard fractionation (2Gy per day) or stereotactic body radiation
      therapy

      Evaluation: Repeat 4D-CT study at 3 months and 6 months post-treatment

      Primary objectives: To assess pre-treatment global and focal lung strain and correlate with
      changes post-treatment

      The study will be a prospective, non-randomized, single center, trial to assess and quantify
      lung strain using 4D-CT treatment planning scans. Patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer
      will be planned using 4D-CT to assess lung and tumor motion. Standard radiation treatment
      plans will to delivered based on tumor stage. Patients will be reassessed both clinically
      and radiographically using 4D-CT imaging at 3 months and 6 months post-treatment. Following
      the initial imaging time points, standard surveillance will be employed with clinical
      assessment and imaging at 3 month intervals for the first 2 years post-treatment.

      To Determine if SAbR improves survival over SR in High Risk Operable Stage I NSCLC
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy has been shown in single institution phase II and matched
      cohort studies to be effective at controlling primary early lung cancer. Recent pooled
      analysis of both the STARS and ROSEL randomized trials comparing SABR versus lobectomy have
      shown a significantly improved 3-year survival with SABR, giving further impetus for
      successful completion of a randomized trial .

      Pre-randomized trial- Patients will be screened and pre-randomized to either SR or SAbR.
      Informed consent will be obtained after patients are made aware of the randomized
      assignment. Despite pre-randomization prior to consent, patients maintain their right to
      accept or decline any/all study activities. Only consenting patients will be allowed to
      participate in study activities, including observation after either randomized treatments or
      observation after standard of care treatment, while those declining consent will be managed
      by their physician(s) off study.Patients will be accrued and followed for a minimum of
      2-years after treatment.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status (PS) 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Radiographic findings consistent with non-small cell lung cancer, including lesions
             with ground glass opacities with a solid component of 50% or greater. Those with
             ground glass opacities and &lt;50% solid component will be excluded.

          -  Biopsy confirmed non-small cell lung cancer.

          -  Tumor ≤ 4 cm maximum diameter, including clinical stage IA and selected IB by PET/CT
             scan of the chest and upper abdomen performed within 60 days prior to registration.

          -  All clinically suspicious mediastinal N1, N2, or N3 lymph nodes (&gt; 1 cm short-axis
             dimension on CT scan and/or positive on PET scan) confirmed negative for involvement
             with NSCLC by one of the following methods: mediastinoscopy, anterior mediastinotomy
             EUS/EBUS guided needle aspiration, CT-guided, video-assisted thoracoscopic or open
             lymph node biopsy.

          -  Tumor verified by a thoracic surgeon to be in a location that will permit sublobar
             resection.

          -  Tumor located peripherally within the lung. NOTE: Peripheral is defined as not
             touching any surface within 2 cm of the proximal bronchial tree in all directions.
             See below. Patients with non-peripheral (central) tumors are NOT eligible.

          -  No evidence of distant metastases.

          -  Availability of pulmonary function tests (PFTs - spirometry, DLCO, +/- arterial blood
             gases) within 90 days prior to registration. Patients with tracheotomy, etc, who are
             physically unable to perform PFTs (and therefore cannot be tested for the Major
             criteria in 3.1.10 below) are potentially still eligible if a study credentialed
             thoracic surgeon documents that the patient's health characteristics would otherwise
             have been acceptable for eligibility as a high risk but nonetheless operable patient
             (in particular be eligible for sublobar resection).

          -  Patient at high-risk for surgery by meeting a minimum of one major criteria or two
             minor criteria

          -  No prior intra-thoracic radiation therapy. NOTE: Previous radiotherapy as part of
             treatment for head and neck, breast, or other non-thoracic cancer is permitted so
             long as possible radiation fields would not overlap. Previous chemotherapy or
             surgical resection specifically for the lung cancer being treated on this protocol is
             NOT permitted. No prior lung resection on the ipsilateral side.

          -  Non-pregnant and non-lactating. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative
             urine or serum pregnancy test within 60 days prior to registration. Peri-menopausal
             women must be amenorrheic &gt; 12 months prior to registration to be considered not of
             childbearing potential.

          -  No prior invasive malignancy, unless disease-free for ≥ 3 years prior to registration
             (exceptions: non-melanoma skin cancer, in-situ cancers).

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  evidence of distant metastases

          -  prior intra-thoracic radiation therapy. NOTE: Previous radiotherapy as part of
             treatment for head and neck, breast, or other non-thoracic cancer is permitted so
             long as possible radiation fields would not overlap. Previous chemotherapy or
             surgical resection specifically for the lung cancer being treated on this protocol is
             NOT permitted. No prior lung resection on the ipsilateral side.

          -  pregnant and lactating women

          -  prior invasive malignancy, unless disease-free for ≥ 3 years prior to registration
             (exceptions: non-melanoma skin cancer, in-situ cancers).

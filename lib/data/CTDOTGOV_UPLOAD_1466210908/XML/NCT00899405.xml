      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at tumor tissue samples and blood samples to learn
      more about DNA changes in patients with lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Examine the mutational status of the EGFR pathway in tumor and blood samples from
           patients with lung cancer.

        -  Correlate the EGFR pathway mutations in these samples with clinical outcomes of these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue and blood samples are analyzed via PCR to detect EGFR pathway
      mutations in DNA.

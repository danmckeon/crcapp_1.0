             ULN (if related to liver metastases &lt; five times ULN)

          -  Recovery from any previous therapy related toxicity to&lt; or = Grade 1 at study entry
             (except for stable sensory neuropathy &lt; or =Grade 2 and alopecia)

          -  Life expectancy of at least three months

          -  Written informed consent that is consistent with International Council on

          -  Age 18 or older

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Prior participation in an afatinib clinical study, even if not assigned to afatinib
             treatment

          -  Prior systemic therapy for metastatic or recurrent NSCLC including prior treatment
             with EGFR targeting small molecules or antibodies. Note: radiotherapy alone and
             adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment is not counted as a line of therapy.

          -  Concurrent investigational therapy or investigational therapy within 4 weeks of start
             of afatinib therapy

          -  Radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment, except as follows:

             i.) Palliative radiation to target organs other than chest may be allowed up to 2
             weeks prior to study treatment, or ii.) Single dose palliative treatment (e.g
             Stereotactic Radio Surgery(SRS) or Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy) (SBRT) for
             symptomatic metastasis outside above allowance to be discussed with sponsor prior to
             enrolling.

          -  Known pre-existing interstitial lung disease

          -  Pathologically documented meningeal carcinomatosis (i.e. cytology (+) lumbar puncture
             ; radiology reports alone raising this as a possibility, in the absence of true
             symptomatology, would not constitute an exclusion)

          -  Presence of brain or subdural metastases, unless local therapy has been completed and
             use of corticosteroids has been discontinued or the dose has been stable for at least
             4 weeks before starting study treatment. Any symptoms attributed to brain metastases
             must be stable for at least 4 weeks before starting study treatment (Pts post SRS can

          -  Any history or presence of poorly controlled gastrointestinal disorders that could
             affect the absorption of the study drug (e.g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis,
             chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption)

          -  Known or suspected active hepatitis B (Hep B) infection (defined as presence of HepB
             (surface Antigen) sAg and/ or Hep B DNA), active hepatitis C infection (defined as

          -  Any history of or concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             would compromise the patient's ability to comply with the study or interfere with the

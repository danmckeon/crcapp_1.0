  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the clinical benefit (how well the drug works), safety and
      tolerability of combining varlilumab and atezolizumab. Phase l of the study will enroll
      patients with a number of tumor types; Phase ll will enroll only patients with renal cell
      carcinoma (RCC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Varlilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called CD27 found
      on certain immune cells and may act to promote anti-tumor effects.

      Atezolizumab is an engineered anti-PD-L1 antibody.

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the anti-CD27 antibody
      varlilumab in combination with atezolizumab.

      Eligible patients that enroll in the dose escalation portion of the study will be assigned
      to one of three dose levels of varlilumab in combination with 1200 mg of atezolizumab. The
      first phase of the study will enroll up to 18 patients and test the safety profile of the
      combination of varlilumab and atezolizumab in patients with various tumor types and
      determine which dose of varlilumab will be studied in Phase ll of the study which will
      enroll only patients with RCC.

      During Phase ll, up to 37 patients will be enrolled and receive the recommended Phase ll
      dose of varlilumab in combination with atezolizumab 1200 mg.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is a
      response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur.

    <description>Treatment cycles are 12 weeks each with varlilumab and atezolizumab administered every 3 weeks. During the treatment phase of the study, eligible patients will receive varlilumab for up to 3 cycles (with a 4th cycle possible following discussion with the Medical Monitor). There is no limit on the number of cycles of atezolizumab. Patients may be discontinued from receiving study treatment (atezolizumab or varlilumab) based on the results of disease assessments or if experiencing side effects that make study therapy intolerable.
Phase l Dose: The planned dose of varlilumab will be dependent on the cohort assigned at enrollment. Varlilumab doses are 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, or 3 mg/kg. The dose of atezolizumab is 1200 mg.
Phase ll Dose: The planned varlilumab dose will be established from the outcome of the Phase l portion of the study. Patients will receive atezolizumab at a dose of 1200 mg.</description>

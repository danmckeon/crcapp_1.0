  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DS-6051b is an orally administered inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases ROS1 and NTRKs. This
      phase 1 first-in-human study evaluates safety and tolerability of DS-6051b in cancer
      subjects and identify a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). In addition, this study will also
      assess the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles and preliminary efficacy of
      DS-6051b.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Dose Escalation part (Part 1) of this study will evaluate safety and tolerability, and
      determine the tentative RP2D. Plasma exposure of DS-6051a and the exposure - QT interval
      prolongation relationship will also be assessed. Approximately 30 subjects with advanced
      solid tumors harboring ROS1 or NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 rearrangement, neuroendocrine
      carcinoma, or with advanced solid tumors and tumor-induced pain will be enrolled.

      After the safety profile of DS-6051b is adequately evaluated, the Dose Expansion part (Part
      2) will be initiated to further assess the safety and tolerability, and preliminarily
      evaluate the efficacy of DS-6051b at the tentative RP2D. Approximately 40 cancer subjects
      carrying a ROS1 or NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 rearrangement will be enrolled.

    <textblock>
      The Archimedes System is an image-guided navigation system used to access tissue samples in
      the lungs. This study is being conducted to confirm the performance of the Archimedes System
      in patients who are scheduled for standard bronchoscopy to diagnose highly suspicious lung
      cancer or metastatic disease. Navigation to and sampling of the patient's lung cancer tumor
      is conducted.

          3. No known endobronchial tumor

          4. Tumor located anywhere in parenchymal tissue &gt;1 cm from pleura and accessible
             bronchoscopically through a POE.

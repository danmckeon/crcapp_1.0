  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the dose escalation phase (Part 1), this study will determine the dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 (RPII) dose of
      NC 6004 in combination with gemcitabine.

      In the expansion phase of the study (Part 2), study will evaluate the activity of NC-6004 in
      combination with Gemcitabine in patients with first-line Stage IV squamous non-smallcell
      lung cancer (NSCLC), first line advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer, and first line
      metastatic or locally advanced bladder cancer.

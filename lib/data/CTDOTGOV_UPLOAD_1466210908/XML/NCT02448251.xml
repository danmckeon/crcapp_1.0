  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AC0010MA is a new, irreversible, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation selective
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor. Aim at local advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
      patients with EGFR mutation or T790M drug-resistant mutation. The molecular mechanism: by
      irreversible combining the EGFR-RTKs ATP binding site of cell, selectively suppress the
      activities of EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, block the signal transduction pathway of
      EGFR and inhibit the function of ras/raf/MAPK downstream, thus block the tumor cell growth
      by EGFR induction, and promotes apoptosis. AC0010MA Maleate Capsules has three characters:
      1. Irreversible binding to EGFR; 2. Efficiently suppresses the tumor cell with EGFR mutant
      and has no suppression to EGFR wild-type cell; 3. Efficient suppress the tumor cell with
      EGFR T790M drug-resistant mutation.

    <description>To determine the recommended SBRT dose to various metastatic locations in patients with advanced solid tumors, and specifically in the lung in patients with NSCLC, in conjunction with pembrolizumab treatment.
Each metastasis targeted with SBRT will be assigned to one of the seven &quot;Metastasis Locations&quot;. Patients will receive 3 or 5 fractions of radiation as determined by the location of the metastases to be irradiated.
Exact logistic regression 13 analyses will be conducted to model the probability of DLT as a function of site dose, number of metastatic sites, and cumulative body radiation. These analyses will be conducted separately for each site using all patients with lesions at that site. If these analyses suggest a high (&gt;=33%) probability of toxicity for a particular combination of predictors, dose recommendations may be modified</description>

          6. For the first 18 patients: Be willing to undergo repeat biopsy of a tumor lesion
             before treatment and after radiation. Subjects for whom newly-obtained samples cannot

          9. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

         10. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the

             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          6. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

             Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may
             qualify for the study.

             Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the

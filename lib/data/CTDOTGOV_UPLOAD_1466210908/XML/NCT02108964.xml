             (applicable to the Phase I part only).

         16. Patients who have impairment of GI function or GI disease that may significantly
             alter the absorption of EGF816 (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea,
             vomiting, diarrhea, or malabsorption syndrome)

         17. Patients who are receiving treatment with any enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant that
             cannot be discontinued at least 1 week before first dose of study treatment, and for
             the duration of the study. Patients on non-enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants are
             eligible

         18. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women

         19. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during the study and for 3 months after stopping the study treatment. Highly
             effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptomthermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study
                  treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of
                  the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male Partner: male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For
                  female subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole
                  partner for that subject.

               -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c):

                    1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy
                       (failure rate &lt; 1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal
                       hormone contraception.

                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository In case of use of oral contraception women should have been
                       stable on the same pill for a minimum of 30 days before taking study
                       treatment.

             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical
             profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical
             bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six
             weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of
             the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered
             not of childbearing potential.

         20. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug
             and for 3 months after stopping treatment; men should not father a child in this
             period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent
             delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

        Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.

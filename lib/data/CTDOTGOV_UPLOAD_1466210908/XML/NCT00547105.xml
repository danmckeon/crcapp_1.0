      RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays
      directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving erlotinib together with
      stereotactic body radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving erlotinib together with
      stereotactic body radiation therapy works in treating patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the effect of erlotinib and stereotactic body radiotherapy on 6-month
           progression-free survival of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small
           cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To describe the actuarial rate of in-field local control and out-of-field disease
           progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To evaluate overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the duration of erlotinib usage and time to initiation of third-line
           systemic therapy (chemotherapy or biologic agent) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 1-4 weeks after the initiation of erlotinib
      hydrochloride, patients undergo stereotactic body radiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

               -  Locally advanced or metastatic disease

          -  Measurable disease

          -  Failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen

          -  No more than 6 discrete active extracranial lesions (≤ 3 in the liver and ≤ 3 in the
             lung) identified by positron emission tomography (PET) and by correlative plain film,
             CT scan, or MRI within 8 weeks prior to the initiation of stereotactic body
             radiotherapy (SBRT)

               -  Residual PET activity is not considered a site of active disease if the CT scan
                  appearance is stable or improved over a period of ≥ 3 months (for patients who
                  received prior radiotherapy to the primary site in the lung)

               -  Patients who received prior radiotherapy to the primary site will be ineligible
                  for the study if there is CT scan evidence of disease progression within the
                  past 3 months

               -  Patients with unirradiated primary sites are potentially eligible for the study

               -  No more than 2 contiguous vertebral metastases will be considered a single site
                  of disease

          -  No metastatic disease invading the esophagus, stomach, intestines, or mesenteric
             lymph nodes

          -  No cutaneous metastasis of NSCLC

          -  No known brain metastases

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times ULN

          -  FEV1 ≥ 1 L (for patients who will be receiving SBRT for lung tumors and who are known
             or suspected by the treating radiation oncologist to have compromised lung function)

          -  Not pregnant

          -  Negative pregnancy test

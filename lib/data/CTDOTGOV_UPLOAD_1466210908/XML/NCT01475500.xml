  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This screening study will address the lack of molecular strategies for the early detection
      of lung cancer and integrate those with epidemiological and imaging strategies.

      The hypothesis is that the repeated measure of biomarkers of risk obtained from the
      molecular analysis of biological specimens including those from bronchoscopy (bronchial
      brushings and biopsies) may contribute to the refinement of high-risk populations and allow
      an earlier clinical diagnosis.

      The goal of the investigators study is to provide screening for lung cancer in a high-risk
      population. In this prospective cohort it will be tested whether repeated measure of
      biomarkers of risk allows early detection of lung cancer.

      It is proposed to test the hypotheses in a screening study of high risk individuals
      (characterized by an established prediction rule). The expected prevalence of lung cancer in
      this high risk group is estimated to be 2% per year. All individuals benefit from clinic
      visit, low-dose Chest CT, spirometry and auto-fluorescence bronchoscopy at baseline, Chest
      CT, follow-up doctor visit, and auto-fluorescence bronchoscopy at least at year 2 and 5.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of personalized
      radiotherapy with four-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT)-based pulmonary ventilation
      imaging, which selectively avoids irradiating highly-functional lung regions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical trial, we will assess the safety and feasibility of 4D CT ventilation
      image-guided personalized radiotherapy. We will deliver personalized radiotherapy treatments
      that selectively avoid irradiating highly-functional lung regions for lung cancer patients,
      and follow up patients to assess the safety and feasibility. The primary hypothesis to be
      tested is: 4D CT ventilation image-guided personalized radiotherapy can be delivered safely
      for lung cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary lung cancer or metastatic disease to the lungs to be treated with either
             conventionally-fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) or hypo-fractionated stereotactic
             ablative radiotherapy (SABR).

          -  Age restriction and/or gender/ethnic restrictions: Patients must be ≥18 years of age.
             There are no gender or ethnic restrictions.

          -  Concurrent chemotherapy is allowed, but not required.

          -  Life expectancy with treatment should be ≥6 months in the estimation of the treating
             physicians.

          -  Zubrod performance status ≤2

          -  Adequate marrow and hepatic function defined as Hgb ≥8; platelets ≥100k; ANC≥1500;
             LFTs ≤2x upper limit of normal and creatinine ≤1.3 or creatinine clearance of ≥50

          -  Patient must be able to provide study specific informed consent prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior radiotherapy for thoracic cancer or other malignancy leading to any overlap of
             planned radiotherapy fields.

          -  For patients undergoing definitive CFRT, patients with distant metastatic disease are
             not eligible.

          -  For patients undergoing SABR, both early stage primary lung cancer patients and those
             with limited metastatic disease to the lungs are eligible; however, patients with
             oligometastatic disease should have a controlled primary and no more than one other
             involved organ system.

          -  Children (&lt;18 years of age), pregnant women, University of California employees or
             students, or prisoners will be excluded from this study.

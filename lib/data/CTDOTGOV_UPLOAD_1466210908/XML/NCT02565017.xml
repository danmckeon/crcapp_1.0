  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn what cancer patients think about IBM Watson Oncology.
      IBM Watson Oncology is a computer program designed to help inform oncologists about the best
      chemotherapy choices for their patients. The investigators will conduct focus groups with
      cancer patients who have received chemotherapy treatment at MSK in order to understand
      cancer patients' thoughts about IBM Watson Oncology.

    <description>After the presentation of the of IBM Watson Oncology at the opening of the focus group, participants will be asked to fill out a de-identified brief 13-item questionnaire to assess participants' first impressions of IBM Watson Oncology. The questionnaire will be self administered, and will take approximately 5 minutes to complete. Completed questionnaires will be collected by a member of the study staff, and the focus group will proceed with introductions. The focus group will be audio recorded from the completion of the introductions and notes will be taken. The focus group guide will address the study aims. At the end of the focus group, participants will complete a 7-item questionnaire to capture simple demographic information including education, income, and health literacy. This questionnaire will take 3-5 minutes to complete.</description>

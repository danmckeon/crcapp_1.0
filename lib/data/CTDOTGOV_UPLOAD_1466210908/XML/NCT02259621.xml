  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) administration in the pre-operative setting will be safe and feasible
      in patients with resectable NSCLC.

      Anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) administration will change cellular and molecular characteristics of
      the tumor microenvironment that can be quantitatively measured.

      Failure to respond to anti-PD-1 in NSCLC results from either pre-existing or compensatory
      (i.e. adaptive) up-regulation of additional immune &quot;checkpoint&quot; pathways in the tumor,
      draining lymph nodes, and/or peripheral blood that inhibit immune recognition and killing of
      tumor cells. Characterization of these pathways (i.e. ligands and receptors) in patients
      receiving preoperative anti-PD-1, and comparison with a cohort of patients who proceed to
      surgical resection without preoperative anti-PD-1, will illuminate mechanisms of adaptation
      and immune resistance to directly guide future therapeutic development of anti-PD-1 as
      monotherapy and in combination with other immunomodulators in NSCLC.

    <description>Safety will be measured by drawing safety labs. (CBC and a Chemistry Panel will be drawn at 2 week intervals during Nivolumab administration). Grade 3 and 4 lab abnormalities will be recorded from both participating sites. Safety will also be measured by recording Grade 3 and 4 CTCAE 4.03 listed adverse events that occur while a subject is participating in the study.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Histologically proven non-small-cell lung cancer (core biopsy required).

          -  Squamous or non-squamous histology (Note - at least 4 squamous patients will be
             included in the total enrollment of 16 patients)

          -  Diagnostic core biopsy specimens must be reviewed by a faculty pathologist at SKCCC
             or MSKCC

          -  Either a formalin fixed paraffin block or a minimum of ten 5-micron tissue sections
             (slides) of tumor biopsy sample must be available for biomarker evaluation (study
             pathologist must review for adequacy of sampling). This can be obtained from archived
             tissues, or from a new biopsy if needed.

        Stage - High risk NSCLC with resection option for potential cure, as assessed by a faculty
        surgeon at SKCCC or MSKCC. This includes clinical stage I (primary tumor must measure â‰¥2cm
        in diameter on CT imaging), II and IIIA (N1 disease only)

        ECOG performance status 0-1

        Stable Lab Values

        Adequate cardiac function as defined by: no evidence of PR prolongation or AV block on
        baseline electrocardiogram (ECG).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any active or history of autoimmune disease (including any history of inflammatory bowel
        disease), or history of syndrome that required systemic steroids or immunosuppressive
        medications, except for subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy.

        Ongoing requirement for systemic corticosteroids. However, inhalational steroids are
        allowed.

        Subjects who require or may require pneumonectomy, as assessed by their surgeon, to obtain
        potentially curative resection of primary tumor.

        Subjects with brain metastasis are excluded from this study and all patients should have
        brain imaging (either MRI brain or CT brain with contrast) prior to enrollment.

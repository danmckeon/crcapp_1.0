  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open-label, dose-escalation trial using &quot;3+3&quot; design, evaluating MM-151
      co-administration with MM-121 at varying dose levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part Phase 1, non-randomized, open-label study of MM-151 plus MM-121 in
      patients with advanced, heregulin-positive lung, head and neck, and colorectal cancers. In
      part 1 of the study cohorts of 3 or more patients will be treated at escalating doses of
      MM-151 in combination with MM-121 until a maximum tolerated combination dose is identified.
      In part 2 of the study, patients with be treated with combination dose identified in part 1
      of the study.

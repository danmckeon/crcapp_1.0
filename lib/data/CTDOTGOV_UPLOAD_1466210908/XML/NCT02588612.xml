      This study is intended for men and women at least 18 years of age who have advanced lung
      cancer which has grown or returned after being treated. In particular, it is a study for
      subjects who have a blood test positive for HLA-A*0201, HLA-A*205 and/or HLA-A*0206 protein
      and a tumor test positive for NY-ESO-1 expression (protein or gene). The study will take the
      subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the blood, and send them to a
      laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study will be the subject's own
      T cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of attacking and destroying cancer
      cells.

      The manufacturing of T cells takes about 1 month to complete. The T cells will be given back
      to the subject through an intravenous infusion. The purpose of this study is to test the
      safety of genetically changed T cells and find out what effects, if any, they have in
      subjects with lung cancer.

      Subjects will be seen frequently by the Study Physician right after receiving their T cells
      back. Subjects will then be entered into a long-term follow up in order to monitor the
      subject. Subjects will be seen every 6 months by their Study Physician for the first 5 years
      after the T cell infusion. If the T cells are found in the blood at five years, then the
      subjects will continue to be seen once a year until the T cells are no longer found in the
      blood for a maximum of 15 years. If the T cells are no longer found in the blood at 5 years,
      then the subject will be contacted by the Study Physician for the next 10 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm study of genetically engineered NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells in HLA-A*0201,
      HLA-A*0205 and/or HLA-A*0206 positive subjects with advanced (Stage IIIb or V) NSCLC.
      Subjects with measurable disease will be screened for general health, performance status and
      disease stage. Following screening, subjects meeting all eligibility will undergo a
      large-volume leukapheresis to obtain cells for the manufacture of autologous NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹
      TCR bearing T cells. When the NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells are available, subjects will receive
      cytoreductive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide 1800mg/ m² on Days -7 &amp; -6 followed by
      infusion of a target dose of 5x10⁹ NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹ transduced T cells (+/- 20%).

      Subjects will visit the clinic for safety and efficacy assessment daily from T cell infusion
      (Day 0) through Day 4, at Day 7, and then weekly until Week 4 and then at 8 weeks, 12 weeks,
      16 weeks, and every 2 months until progression of their disease (or withdrawal of consent
      for the interventional portion of the study).

      Subjects who have progressive disease following response to the initial infusion but whose
      tumors continue to express the appropriate antigen target will be eligible for a second
      infusion with engineered T-cells.

      All subjects, completing or withdrawing from the interventional portion of the study, will
      enter a long-term follow-up study for observation of delayed adverse events. During the
      first 5 years post T-cell infusion, subjects will be seen in the clinic every 6 months for a
      physical examination and blood tests. After 5 years, the subjects will be followed up
      annually for up to 15 years.

                  antibody is positive, a screening HCV RNA by any RT PCR or bDNA assay must be
                  performed at screening by a local laboratory with a CLIA certification or its
                  equivalent. Eligibility will be determined based on a negative screening value.
                  The test is not required if documentation of a negative result of a HCV RNA test
                  performed within 60 days prior to screening is provided.

        Furthermore and prior to cytoreductive chemotherapy, a subject meeting the following
        criteria is not eligible for participation in the study:

          1. Subject who has had monoclonal antibodies within 6 weeks; surgery, cytotoxic
             chemotherapy, immune therapy, biological therapy within 3 weeks; corticosteroids or
             any other immunosuppressive therapy within 2 weeks; tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
             (e.g. erlotinib, gefitinib) within 1 week prior to starting cytoreductive
             chemotherapy. NOTE: A brief course of oral corticosteroids limited to less than 7
             days is not exclusionary if completed 2 weeks prior to cytoreductive chemotherapy.

          2. Radiotherapy to the chest within 3 months prior to chemotherapy. (Note: there is no
             washout period for palliative radiation to non-target organs other than the chest. If
             radiation was to an intended target lesion within 3 months of baseline imaging
             studies, and the lesion is progressing within this time frame it may be considered as
             a target lesion after review and discussion with the sponsor.)

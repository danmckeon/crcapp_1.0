  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, radiation has on the
      lungs has on the patient and on synovial sarcoma which has spread to the lungs. The standard
      treatment for synovial sarcoma which has spread to the lungs is chemotherapy with or without
      surgery to remove the tumors in the lungs. However, tumors often come back in the lungs
      after chemotherapy and/or surgery. Since synovial sarcoma is known to be sensitive to
      radiation, this study is looking at whether radiation therapy which is targeted to the
      entire lung can further reduce the chances of the cancer returning. This type of radiation
      is commonly used in other types of sarcoma to treat the cancer once it has spread to the
      lungs and it may be very useful in synovial sarcoma as well.

      In this study, a special type of radiation will be used, called Intensity Modulated
      Radiation Therapy (IMRT). With IMRT the radiation beams are more customized to focus more
      radiation on the tumor cells while delivering less radiation to areas like the heart. The
      goal of this study is also to measure pulmonary toxicity and see if IMRT is feasible and has
      less toxicity.

    <description>This is a single institution study involving patients with synovial sarcoma who have completed all standard therapy (e.g. surgery +/- radiation to the primary site) +/- any adjuvant chemotherapy. The sequence and types of therapy offered prior to WLI will likely vary based on primary tumor site, tumor resectability, extent of metastatic disease, performance status, and comorbidity. Each patient's therapy will be determined by the disease management team irrespective of participation on this protocol.</description>

    <description>External beam radiation therapy will be administered on an outpatient basis, once daily (except weekends and holidays) for approximately two weeks. Patients will undergo a simulation prior to initiation of radiation. Once an IMRT plan is generated which meets all dose constraints specified patients will be treated with 6MV photons for 10 treatments.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with synovial sarcoma confirmed by MSKCC pathological review

          -  Patients with single or multiple lung metastases at diagnosis or that develop over
             the course of treatment. After completion of all chemotherapy, lung metastases or
             must be ≤ 2cm.

          -  Age ≥12 months of age

          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) must be ≥ 70 for patients ≥ 16 years of age and
             Lansky performance status must be ≥ 70 for patients &lt; 16 years of age.

          -  Normal cardiac function

          -  No active coronary artery disease;

          -  No New York Heart Association class II, III or IV disease;

          -  No arrhythmia requiring treatment.

          -  Baseline echocardiogram with a shortening fraction of ≥27% or an ejection fraction ≥
             50%.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within
             14 days of radiation start.

          -  Female patients who are lactating must agree to stop breast-feeding.

          -  Sexually active patients of childbearing potential must agree to use effective
             contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of prior radiation therapy to the thorax.

          -  Patients requiring a field size &gt;40 cm as IMRT cannot be performed at extended SSDs.

          -  Patients with any concurrent medical or psychiatric condition or disease which, in
             the investigator's judgment, would make them inappropriate candidates for entry into
             this study.

      This first time in human study is intended for men and women at least 18 years of age who
      have advanced lung cancer which has grown or returned after being treated. In particular, it
      is a study for subjects who have a blood test positive for HLA-A*0201 and/or HLA-A*0206
      protein and a tumor test positive for MAGE A10 expression (protein or gene). The study will
      take the subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the blood, and send
      them to a laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study will be the
      subject's own T cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of attacking and
      destroying cancer cells.

      The manufacturing of T cells takes about 1 month to complete. The T cells will be given back
      to the subject through an intravenous infusion. The purpose of this study is to test the
      safety of genetically changed T cells and find out what effects, if any, they have in
      subjects with lung cancer. The study will evaluate three different cell dose levels in order
      to find out the target cell dose. Once the target cell dose is determined, additional
      subjects will be enrolled to further test the safety and effects at this cell dose.

      Subjects will be seen frequently by the Study Physician right after receiving their T cells
      back. Subjects will then be entered into a long-term follow up in order to monitor the
      subject. Subjects will be seen every 6 months by their Study Physician for the first 5 years
      after the T cell infusion. If the T cells are found in the blood at five years, then the
      subjects will continue to be seen once a year until the T cells are no longer found in the
      blood for a maximum of 15 years. If the T cells are no longer found in the blood at 5 years,
      then the subject will be contacted by the Study Physician for the next 10 years.

      This is first time in human study is a single-arm study of genetically engineered MAGE
      A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cells in HLA-A*0201 and/or HLA-A*0206 positive subjects with advanced (Stage IIIb
      or V) NSCLC. Subjects with measurable disease will be screened for general health,
      performance status and disease stage. Following screening, subjects meeting all eligibility
      will undergo a large-volume leukapheresis to obtain cells for the manufacture of autologous
      MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶TCR bearing T cells. When the NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells are available, subjects will
      receive cytoreductive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide 1800mg/ m² on Days -7 &amp; -6.

      This trial is a dose escalation trial that will evaluate 3 doses of transduced cells using a
      3+3 dose escalation design. The doses for each cell dose group are as follows.

      Group 1: 0.1 x10⁹ (+/- 20%) transduced cells. Group 2: 1 x10⁹ (+/- 20%) transduced cells.
      Group 3: 5 x10⁹ (range 1-6 x10⁹) transduced cells.

      There will be a 21-day staggering of treatment in between treating subjects in Group 1 and a
      7-day stagger between treating subjects in Groups 2 and 3.

      A DLT is defined as any clinical toxicity of Grade 3 or higher (using NCI CTC version 4.03)
      regardless of investigator's assessment of relationship to the gene-modified T-cell
      infusion. If there are no DLTs in any of the first 3 subjects enrolled in Groups 1 and 2,
      then enrolment can proceed into the next higher dose (Groups 2 and 3). If one subject
      develops a DLT at a specific cell dose, then an additional three subjects will be enrolled
      into that same dose group. A DLT in more than 1 out of 6 subjects within a given group will
      trigger a pause in enrolment and an overall assessment of the safety data observed to date.
      The cell dose in Group 3 will be the highest cell dose studied even if no DLTs are observed.
      The sample size of the target cell dose may be expanded up to 20 subjects to characterize
      safety and any preliminary evidence of antitumor activity.

      Subjects will visit the clinic for safety and efficacy assessment daily from T cell infusion
      (Day 0) through Day 4, Days 7, 9, and 11, and then weekly until Week 4 and then at 8 weeks,
      12 weeks, 16 weeks, and every 2 months until progression of their disease (or withdrawal of
      consent for the interventional portion of the study).

      Subjects who have progressive disease following response to the initial infusion but whose
      tumors continue to express the appropriate antigen target will be eligible for a second
      infusion with engineered T-cells.

      All subjects, completing or withdrawing from the interventional portion of the study, will
      enter a long-term follow-up study for observation of delayed adverse events. During the
      first 5 years post T-cell infusion, subjects will be seen in the clinic every 6 months for a
      physical examination and blood tests. After 5 years, the subjects will be followed up
      annually for up to 15 years.

             exclusionary if completed 2 weeks prior to cytoreductive chemotherapy. Subjects must
             be 3 weeks from major surgery.

          2. Radiotherapy to the chest within 3 months prior to chemotherapy. (NOTE: there is no
             washout period for palliative radiation to non-target organs other than the chest. If
             radiation was to an intended target lesion within 3 months of baseline imaging
             studies, and the lesion is progressing within this time frame it may be considered as
             a target lesion after review and discussion with the sponsor.)

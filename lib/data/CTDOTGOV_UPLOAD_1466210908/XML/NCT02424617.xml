      A Phase I/2 multi-center open-label study of BGB324 in combination with erlotinib in
      patients with Stage IIIb or Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, multi-arm open-label Phase I/2 study that will be conducted at up to
      4 clinical sites in the US.

      Up to approximately 66 patients with histologically- or cytologically-confirmed Stage IIIb
      or Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer will receive BGB324 as a single agent (Run-in Cohort)
      or in combination with erlotinib (Arms A-C).

      The dose of erlotinib will be 150 mg daily (Arms A - C). A dose of 100 mg daily will be
      permitted in Arms B and C only. In Arm A, the dose of BGB324 will be escalated in a standard
      3+3 fashion until an MTD of the combination is established. At this point, Arm B and Arm C
      will be initiated. It is intended that the BGB324 MTD dose observed in Arm A will be used in
      Arms B and C, but a lower dose level may be incorporated upon recommendation of the Safety
      Review Committee. Dose escalation beyond the Arm A MTD level is not planned for Arm B or Arm
      C.

It is anticipated that a maximum of three BGB324 dose levels will be evaluated, with up to approximately 18 patients enrolled. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients will be allowed to continue receiving BGB324 in combination with erlotinib until disease progression.</description>

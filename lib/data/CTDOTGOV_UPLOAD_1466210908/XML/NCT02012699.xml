  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this project at UNMC are to consolidate existing and future disease
      specific registries with biospecimen bank to provide a resource that fosters and improves
      the efficiency of cancer-related research and facilitates collaborations among centers. The
      Integrated Cancer Repository for Cancer Research (iCaRe2) consists mainly of registry
      database and human biological material (HBM). The type of HBM to be stored include blood
      (and its derivatives), urine and tissue. The source of the HBM will be from voluntary blood
      draw, urine collection and UNMC Solid Tumor Bank (IRB#281-96).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are seven registries/tissue bank developed under the umbrella of iCaRe2:
      the Pancreatic Cancer Collaborative Registry (PCCR), Thyroid Cancer and Tumor Collaborative
      Registry (TCCR), GenitoUrinary Cancer Collaborative Registry (GUCaRe), Thoracic Oncology
      Collaborative Registry (TOCR), Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Cancer Collaborative Registry
      (GACCaRe), Head and Neck Cancer Collaborative Registry (HNCCR), Central Nervous System Tumor
      Collaborative Registry (CTCR) for collaborative multi-center research. These Cancer
      Registries (CR) were established to unite participating centers with expertise in cancer
      epidemiology, genetics, biology, early detection and patient care to facilitate the rapid
      and uniform collection of critical information and biological samples to be used in
      developing prevention, detection and treatment strategies against cancer. Fred and Pamela
      Buffett Cancer Center also adopted the caTISSUE Suite
      (https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/tools/catissuesuite), a biorepository tool that has been
      developed under the NCI's cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIGÂ®) umbrella. The Cancer
      Registry (CR) database is coupled with the biospecimen annotation database (caTISSUE) to
      manage activities associated with the biospecimen inventorying, tracking, and basic
      annotation. It provides quality assurance for all these activities and permits the users to
      track the collection, storage and distribution (derivation and aliquot) of specimens. This
      consolidated tissue bank will continue to collect and store comprehensive data on cancer
      patients, survivors and high-risk individuals. The tissue bank couples with the caTissue
      Suite for annotation and management of the biospecimen data to be collected. Consolidating
      all the registries into one tissue bank will foster and improve the efficiency of
      cancer-related research and facilitates collaborations among centers. The PI from each
      registry will remain the sole contact and will maintain responsibility of the conduct of
      each registry. For the purpose of consolidation into one IRB application, each PI is being
      assigned as Sub-PI. Namely, PCCR - Dr.Aaron Sasson, TCCR - Dr. Whitney Goldner, GUCaRe - Dr.
      Chad LaGrange , TOCR - Dr.Karin Trujillo, GACCaRe- Dr. Jason Foster, HNCCR- Dr.

      Russell Smith, CTCR- Dr. Nicole Shonka respectively.

      Blood: obtain 30 ml of blood at enrollment and an additional 30ml may be obtained biannually
      or at recurrence.

      Urine: obtain 1/4 cup of urine at enrollment date. Additional 1/4 cup of urine may be
      collected at follow up visits.

      The purpose of the trial is to establish the tolerability of HuMax-TF-ADC in a mixed
      population of patients with specified solid tumors
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted in two parts. The dose escalation portion of the trial subjects are
      enrolled into cohorts at increasing dose levels of HuMax-TF-ADC in 21 day treatment cycles.

      In the Cohort Expansion part of the trial, will further explore the recommended phase 2 dose
      of HuMax-TF-ADC as determined in Part 1

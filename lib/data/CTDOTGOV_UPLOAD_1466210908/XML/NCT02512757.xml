      This is a prospective, multi-center study to evaluate the diagnostic performance
      characteristics of the AminoIndex™ technology among patients at high risk for developing
      lung cancer as compared with standard lung cancer screening and diagnostic procedures
      including low-dose CT, high-dose CT, biopsy and histopathology.

      This is a prospective, multi-center study to evaluate the diagnostic performance
      characteristics of the AminoIndex™ technology among patients at high risk for developing
      lung cancer as compared with standard lung cancer screening and diagnostic procedures
      including low-dose CT, high-dose CT, biopsy and histopathology.

      The study will enroll patients into one of three arms:

        1. patients with lung nodule(s) ≥ 6 mm but ≤ 30 mm that have been biopsied and diagnosed
           with primary lung cancer who have not yet initiated treatment of any kind for their
           lung cancer;

        2. patients with lung nodule(s) ≥ 6 mm but ≤ 30 mm that have been biopsied and determined
           to not be cancerous OR that have demonstrated no nodule growth for &gt; 2 years by repeat
           CT imaging; and

        3. patients at high-risk for lung cancer (per NLST guidelines) with no evidence or history
           of lung cancer (negative LDCT/CT/X-ray).

        Study will enroll sufficient subjects to yield a minimum of 60 subjects in Study Group 1,
        30 subjects in Study Group 2 and 60 subjects in Study Group 3 - a total of 150 evaluable
        study subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible subjects will be
        men and women age 55 - 79, inclusive. Group 3 study subjects must also meet NLST
        guidelines of being at high risk for lung cancer: greater than or equal to a 30 pack year
        smoking history (equivalent of 1 pack per day for 30 or more years) and a current smoker
        or quit less than 15 years ago.

             cancer within 1 year prior to signing informed consent (Group 3 only)

          -  Inability to fast for 8 hours prior to the blood sample collection.

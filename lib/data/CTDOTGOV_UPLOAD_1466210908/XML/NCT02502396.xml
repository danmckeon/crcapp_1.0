      Objectives:

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the practice patterns of rivaroxaban
      usage invenous-thromboembolism (VTE) and non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in cancer
      patients.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate outcomes such as recurrent VTE, stroke and bleeding
      for cancer patients on rivaroxaban.

      This retrospective descriptive study will review charts of approximately375 cancer patients
      prescribed rivaroxaban from January 1, 2012 to January 6, 2015 at UT MDACC for NVAF or
      patients that had prior VTE and diagnosis of cancer. The list of patients prescribed
      rivaroxaban during the study period will be obtained from Pharmacy Informatics. We will
      review the eligibility of all patients on the pharmacy list who were prescribed rivaroxaban
      during the study time-frame. The eligible patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria
      will be identified. All available data concerning demographic, clinical parameters and
      rivaroxaban usage will be collected for eligible patients from Pharmacy Informatics, CS,
      Laboratory Informatics, and Clinical Informatics Databases. The variables of interest
      include demographic information, clinical parameters (tumor type, extent of disease,
      clinical exam findings, and presence of comorbidities, diagnostic assessments, and treatment
      interventions), reason for rivaroxaban discontinuation and outcomes. The confidentiality of
      all patient-specific data will be maintained. By using Pharmacy Informatics and CS, we can
      capture most of patients prescribed rivaroxaban at the UT MDACC.This is a descriptive study
      and the final sample size will depend on available records for chart review from 01/01/2012
      to 01/06/2015.

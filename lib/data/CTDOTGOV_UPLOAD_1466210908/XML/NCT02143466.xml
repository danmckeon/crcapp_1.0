  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and preliminary
      anti-tumour activity of AZD9291 when given together with one of either MEDI4736, AZD6094 or
      selumetinib in patients with EGFR mutation positive advanced lung cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multicentre study of AZD9291 administered orally in
      combination with novel therapeutics (MEDI4736, AZD6094 or selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY142886)

      ) to patients with EGFRm+ advanced NSCLC. The study has been designed to allow an
      investigation of the optimal combination dose and schedule whilst ensuring the safety of
      patients with intensive safety monitoring. There are two parts to this study. Part A,
      Combination dose finding and Part B, Dose expansion.

      AZD9291 is a potent irreversible inhibitor of both the single Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor (EGFR) mutation positive (Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor [TKI]-sensitivity conferring
      mutations, EGFRm+) and T790M positive (TKI-resistance conferring mutation, T790M+) receptor
      forms of the EGFR with a wide margin of selectivity against EGFR wild-type (WT).

      AZD9291 acts on cancer by blocking abnormal EGFR-mediated signalling, leading to profound
      tumour growth inhibition in EGFR mutation bearing xenografts of non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) tumours. Preliminary data from a large phase I study (study D5160C00001) has
      provided data on the safety and clinical activity of monotherapy AZD9291 in this patient
      population.

        while on a previous continuous treatment with an EGFR TKI. In addition other lines of

        Part B cMET+ve patients

        2nd line cohort: only one prior line of therapy, which must be an EGFR TKI, but not a
        T790M-directed agent

        this study must be a T790M directed EGFR TKI

        ≥2nd line cohort: Patients must have progressed while on treatment with an EGFR TKI (T790M
        directed EGFR TKIs are permitted). Other prior lines of therapy may have been given

        At least one lesion that can be used as a measurable lesion for the purposes of RECIST
        assessments WHO performance status 0-1 with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and
        minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks

        Females should be using adequate contraceptive measures, should not be breast feeding and

        hypertension, active bleeding diatheses, or active infection.

        Inadequate bone marrow reserve or organ function

        Inability to swallow the formulated product or previous significant bowel resection that
        would preclude adequate absorption Past medical history of interstitial lung disease,

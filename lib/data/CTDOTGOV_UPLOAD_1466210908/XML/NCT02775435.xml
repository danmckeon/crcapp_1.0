  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of carboplatin and paclitaxel or nano particle albumin-bound paclitaxel
      (nab-paclitaxel) with or without pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) in adults with first
      line metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      The primary hypotheses are that treatment with pembrolizumab prolongs: 1) Progression-free
      Survival (PFS) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as
      assessed by a blinded central imaging vendor compared to placebo, and 2) Overall Survival
      (OS).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive up to a maximum of 4 cycles of carboplatin, paclitaxel or
      nab-paclitaxel and pembrolizumab or saline placebo. Treatment with pembrolizumab or saline
      placebo will continue until a total of 35 treatment administrations of pembrolizumab or
      saline placebo therapy have been administered, documented disease progression, unacceptable
      adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,
      investigator's decision to withdraw the participant, participant withdraws consent,
      pregnancy of the participant, noncompliance with the trial treatment or procedure
      requirements or administrative reasons.

      Participants who experience documented disease progression verified by central imaging
      vendor will have treatment assignment unblinded and be able to continue on open-label
      pembrolizumab monotherapy in the Crossover Phase. In the optional Crossover Phase of the
      study, participants who had received saline placebo will be able to receive open-label
      pembrolizumab monotherapy for a total of 35 treatments, and participants who had received
      pembrolizumab, but are deemed to be benefiting clinically despite progression, will be able
      to receive open-label pembrolizumab monotherapy to complete a total of 35 treatments.

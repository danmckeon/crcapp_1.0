    <textblock>
      Assess the safety and feasibility of local oncological drug delivery into the bronchial wall
      after recanalization of subjects with malignant airway obstruction. Safety and feasibility
      (technical success) will be assessed.

      This localized delivery is intended as an adjunct therapy and all subjects will receive
      standard of care oncology therapy as determined by their treating physicians.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Second primary malignancy, except for non-melanoma skin cancer and in situ cervical
             cancer

             best interest of the patient Intraoperative Exclusion Criteria

          -  Use of pulmonary airway stents and/or ongoing or initiation of local external beam or
             brachytherapy radiation

          -  Any intraoperative complications that per the investigator's judgment increase the
             risk to the patient.

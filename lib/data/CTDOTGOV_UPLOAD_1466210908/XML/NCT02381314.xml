  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of MGA271 in combination with Yervoy
      (ipilimumab) when given to patients with B7-H3-expressing melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma
      of the head and neck (SCCHN), non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other B7H3 expressing
      cancers. The study will also evaluate what is the best dose of MGA271 to use when given with
      ipilimumab. Assessments will also be done to see how the drug acts in the body
      (pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics) and to evaluate potential anti-tumor activity of
      MGA271 in combination with ipilimumab.

      This study is a Phase 1 open-label, dose escalation, and cohort expansion study of MGA271
      administered intravenously (IV) on a weekly schedule for up to 51 doses in combination with
      IV ipilimumab administered on an every-3-week schedule for 4 doses.

      The dose escalation phase is designed to characterize the safety and tolerability of the
      combination of MGA271 and ipilimumab and to define the maximum tolerated or administered
      dose (MTD/MAD) in patients with B7-H3 expressing mesothelioma, urothelial cancer, NSCLC,
      SCCHN, Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ovarian cancer, melanoma, thyroid cancer,
      Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, soft tissue sarcoma,
      or prostate cancer.

      The cohort expansion phase, 3 cohorts of 16 patients each will be enrolled to further
      evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of the combination administered at the MTD/MAD
      dose in patients with melanoma, NSCLC, and SCCHN.

      All tumor evaluations will be carried out by both Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) and immune-related response criteria (irRC).

             inhibitor (e.g., anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4) as the most recent prior therapy

          -  SCHNN or NSCLC that has progressed during or following 1 - 5 prior systemic regimens

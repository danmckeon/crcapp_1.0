  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Cancer Support Community's (CSC) Research and Training Institute has created the Cancer
      Experience Registry: An Online Initiative to Change the Future of Cancer Care to identify
      and understand the emotional and social needs of cancer survivors. Armed with this
      knowledge, the investigators will raise awareness about and help develop programs to address
      the needs of cancer survivors. Anyone who has ever received a cancer diagnosis, whether
      recently diagnosed, in treatment, or years post-treatment can participate. Interested cancer
      survivors can register at www.cancerexperienceregistry.org

      The online registry will allow CSC's Research and Training Institute to report annually on
      trends and changes in the emotional health status of cancer survivors. Such data collection
      and tracking will serve as the basis for increasing public awareness and in developing
      effective programs to address the often misunderstood and under served needs of cancer
      survivors. The registry will fill a critical gap by providing a mechanism to learn directly
      from cancer survivors what issues they face.

      The Cancer Support Community's Research and Training Institute will disseminate an annual
      report to highlight the findings of the registry. The report will be available to the cancer
      community at large.

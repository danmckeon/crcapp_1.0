      Background:

      - The current standard of care for advanced lung cancer and cancers of the thymus consists
      primarily of chemotherapy treatment. The drugs used for chemotherapy depend on the
      classification of the cancer in different categories that are based on the appearance of the
      cancer in the microscope. Though this approach has been proved to be useful in some ways,
      the survival rates of individuals with lung cancer and cancers of the thymus are still very
      poor. Recent research has shown that several genetic abnormalities play an important role in
      the development and growth of lung cancer and cancers of the thymus, and that it is possible
      to improve treatment success rates with drugs that specifically target some of the abnormal
      genes. Researchers are interested in determining whether it is possible to analyze the genes
      of patients with lung cancer and cancers of the thymus in order to provide personalized
      treatment with drugs that target the specific gene abnormalities.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the effectiveness of genetic analysis in determining targeted therapy for
      individuals with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, and thymic
      cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with either lung cancer or a
      cancer of the thymus that is not considered to be curable with the use of surgery or
      radiation therapy.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination,
           blood and urine tests, and tumor imaging studies. Participants will have a tumor biopsy
           or provide previously collected tumor tissue for study.

        -  Based on the results of the tumor biopsy study, participants will be separated into
           different treatment groups:

        -  Participants with EGFR gene mutation will receive a drug called erlotinib, which
           inhibits a protein called EGFR that is thought to be a key factor in the development
           and progression of some cancers.

        -  Participants with KRAS, BRAF, HRAS, or NRAF gene mutations will receive a drug called
           AZD6244, which inhibits a protein called MEK that is thought to be a key factor in the
           development and progression of some cancers.

        -  Participants with PIK3CA, AKT, or PTEN gene mutations will receive a drug called
           MK-2206, which inhibits a protein called AKT that is thought to be a key factor in the
           development and progression of some cancers.

        -  Participants with KIT or PDGFRA gene mutations will receive a drug called sunitinib,
           which inhibits some proteins that are thought to be key factors in the development and
           progression of some cancers, including kidney cancer.

        -  Participants who have ERBB2 gene mutation or amplification will receive a drug called
           lapatinib, which inhibits some proteins that are thought to be key factors in the
           development and progression of some cancers, including breast cancer.

        -  Participants who do not have any of the genetic abnormalities described above will be
           offered different options for treatment, including standard of care chemotherapy or
           treatment with investigational agents in a different research protocol.

        -  After 6 weeks of treatment, participants will have imaging studies to evaluate the
           status of their cancer. Treatment will continue as long as participants tolerate the
           drugs and the disease does not progress.

        -  Participants who benefit from the first treatment but eventually develop resistance and
           progression of their cancer will be offered the chance to have a second tumor biopsy
           and undergo a different treatment for their cancer.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  A better understanding of the genetic make-up of the individual tumor may offer
           potentially improved therapies. This approach may also give rapid access to response
           data in patients with sometimes rare genetic abnormalities.

        -  In addition, it will allow us to test targeted therapies in a select population of
           patients that is more likely to have a favorable response based on their molecular
           profile and the specific mechanism of action of the drug being tested.

        -  This approach will also speed up drug development and potentially approval, and rescue
           an otherwise ineffective drug candidate for the specific subgroup that can benefit.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the feasibility of the use of tumor s molecular profiling and targeted
           therapies in the treatment of advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small
           cell lung cancer (SCLC) and thymic malignancies.

        -  To estimate the response rate of molecular-profile directed treatments in NSCLC, SCLC
           and thymic malignancies patients.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Patients with histologically confirmed advanced lung cancer or thymic malignancies for
           whom surgical resection with curative intent is not feasible.

        -  Patients must either have biopsiable disease and be willing to undergo biopsy for

      molecular profiling or have paraffin embedded tissue blocks suitable for molecular

      profiling analysis.

        -  Individuals are eligible for EGFR germline mutation testing if they have:

        -  a personal history of invasive lung cancer or one of the pre-invasive histologies

      associated with the development of lung cancer and more than two affected family

      DESIGN:

        -  All patients will have their tumors undergo molecular profiling. Based on these results
           and on other eligibility criteria, the patients will be offered enrollment into
           different targeted therapy arms.

        -  At the NCI site only, individuals eligible for EGFR germline mutation will undergo
           testing for germline mutations affecting the EGFR gene; if a mutation is detected,
           their first-degree relatives would be invited to undergo testing for the index germline
           mutation found in the proband and appropriate follow-up on trial.

        -  Effective with Amendment I, the participating site, OHSU, will discontinue new
           enrollments and data entry for existing patients on the NOS arm on this protocol in
           favor of the OHSU protocol L8639, Personalized Cancer Medicine Registry. The data from
           these patients will be included with the data from 11-C-0096 (8639) NCI patients at the
           time of publication. Any OHSU patients who are eligible for a treatment arm will
           continue to be enrolled and followed per protocol.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INITIAL ENROLLMENT:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed advanced NSCLC, SCLC and thymic malignancies
             for whom surgical resection or multimodality therapy with curative intent is not
             feasible. For patients with Stage III NSCLC, who can be encompassed by a radiation
             port, definitive XRT should have been performed first when possible.

          -  Individuals who meet the eligibility criteria for EGFR germline mutation testing but
             who do not have advanced cancer as defined in 3.1.1 may enroll for EGFR germline
             mutation testing only and will not be eligible for the treatment or NOS arms.

          -  Patients with advanced cancer must meet one of the following criteria (does not apply
             to firstdegree relatives or individuals with pre-invasive histology enrolling only
             for EGFR germline mutation testing):

               -  Patients must have biopsiable disease and be willing to undergo biopsy for
                  molecular profiling

        OR

        -Patients must have enough and adequate archival material from a previous biopsy to
        perform molecular profiling analyses. The adequacy of the material provided will be
        determined by the principal investigator in conjunction with the laboratories performing
        the molecular profiling analyses

        OR

          -  Patients must have previously undergone a successful molecular profiling of their
             tumor with mutation analysis of the genes described in section 5.2, as part of this
             protocol (crossover patients) or other molecular profiling protocols such as the Lung
             Cancer Mutation Consortium protocol among others.

          -  Age greater than or equal to18 years.

        ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR ENROLLMENT INTO THE TREATMENT ARMS

        Please refer to section 3.3 of the protocol for eligibility criteria for enrollment in the
        specific molecular profile / treatment arms of this protocol.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;
             20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan.

             -Target lesions cannot be selected within previously irradiated areas, if not newly
             arising or clearly progressing after irradiation as proven by repeat scanning.

          2. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          3. Performance status (ECOG) 2 (See Appendix C).

          4. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes: &gt; 1,500/mcL

               -  absolute neutrophil count: &gt; 1,000/mcL

               -  platelets: &gt; 100,000/mcL

               -  total bilirubin*: &lt; 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal

                  --For patients with Gilbert s syndrome or levels of indirect bilirubin above the
                  upper limit of normal, direct bilirubin will be used for eligibility and should
                  be &lt; 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal.

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT): less than 3 times the institutional upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine: less than or equal to1.5 times the institutional upper limits of
                  normal

             OR creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with creatinine levels
             above 1.5 times the institutional normal.

          5. Patients must have recovered from toxicity related to prior therapy (chemotherapy,
             surgery or radiation) to grade 1 (defined by CTCAE: The NCI Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4(CTCAE) will be used for toxicity and adverse
             event reporting. All appropriate treatment areas have access to a copy of the CTCAE
             version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site
             (http://ctep.cancer.gov).

          6. The effects of most of the therapeutic agents used in this trial on the developing
             human fetus at the recommended therapeutic doses are unknown. For this reason and
             because some agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and
             men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation, and continue for at least 16 weeks after completing the study to avoid
             pregnancy and/or potential adverse effects on the developing embryo. Should a woman
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with targeted therapies, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with targeted therapies.

          7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients who have had major surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks
             prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due
             to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier.

          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents or other medications
             for the treatment of their malignancy.

          3. Patients with symptomatic brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical
             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive
             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other
             adverse events. However, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastases
             and whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for at least 1 week
             after the end of brain radiation may be enrolled to undergo molecular profiling at
             the discretion of the principal investigator. In addition, brain metastatic disease
             should be stable for at least 4 weeks, before the patients can be enrolled in any of
             the experimental treatment arms.

          4. Patients with any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an
             inability to take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior
             surgical procedures affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that
             impairs their ability to swallow and retain tablets are excluded.

          5. Any uncontrolled medical illness that precludes the patient from undergoing a biopsy
             for molecular profiling and / or receiving treatment under one of the experimental
             arms of the study should be excluded. These conditions include but are not limited
             to:

               -  Ongoing or uncontrolled, symptomatic congestive heart failure (Class III or IV
                  as defined by the NYHA functional classification system (see Appendix D).

               -  Uncontrolled hypertension

               -  Unstable angina pectoris

               -  Cardiac arrhythmia

               -  Uncontrolled diabetes

               -  Uncontrolled psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance
                  with study requirements.

          6. Patients with QTc prolongation (defined as a QTc interval equal to or greater than
             500 msec) or other significant ECG abnormalities are excluded.

          7. Caution should be used if patients are required to use a concomitant medication that
             can prolong the QT interval and efforts should be made to switch to a different
             medication before the patient begins treatment under an experimental arm. See
             Appendix E for a table of medications with the potential to prolong the QTc interval.
             A comprehensive list of agents with the potential to cause QTc prolongation can be
             found at: http://www.azcert.org/medical-pros/drug-lists/bycategory.cfm

          8. The eligibility of patients taking medications that are potent inducers or inhibitors
             of that enzyme will be determined following a review of their case by the Principal
             Investigator. (A list of potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors can be found in
             Appendix F). Every effort should be made to switch patients taking such agents or
             substances to other medications before they begin treatment with one of the
             experimental drug included in this protocol, particularly patients with gliomas or
             brain metastases who are taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant agents. A
             comprehensive list of medications and substances known or with the potential to alter
             the pharmacokinetics of sunitinib through CYP3A4 is provided in Appendix F.

          9. Patients with tumor amenable to potentially curative therapy as assessed by the
             investigator.

         10. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because many of the FDA approved agents
             and investigational agents in this trial have the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated in this protocol. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

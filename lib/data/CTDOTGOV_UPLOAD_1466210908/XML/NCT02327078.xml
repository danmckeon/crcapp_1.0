    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open label study that will be conducted in 2 parts. The first part of
      the study (Phase 1) will consist of a dose-escalation assessment of the safety and
      tolerability of epacadostat administered with nivolumab in subjects with select advanced
      solid tumors and lymphomas including melanoma (MEL), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
      colorectal cancer (CRC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCHN), ovarian cancer, and
      B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The second part (Phase 2) of the
      study will include expansion cohorts in the tumor types tested in Phase 1 (except diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) will be the only lymphoma permitted and Phase 2 will also
      include a cohort for glioblastoma) with a) historically good activity with nivolumab
      monotherapy, and b) with historically low activity with nivolumab monotherapy.

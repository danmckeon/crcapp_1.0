  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open label, multi-center study of CMB305 (sequentially administered
      LV305 [a dendritic cell-targeting viral vector expressing the NY-ESO-1 gene] and G305
      [NY-ESO-1 recombinant protein plus GLA-SE]) in patients with melanoma, sarcoma, ovarian
      cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer that express NY-ESO-1.

      CMB305 is a novel in vivo approach designed to stimulate the body's immune system to fight
      the spread and growth of cancer for patients whose tumors express the NY-ESO-1 protein.
      LV305 will be given in a prime-boost approach with G305 to induce a synergistic
      immunotherapeutic response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate and examine the safety and immunogenicity of the
      combinatorial regimen called CMB305, where intradermal LV305 is administered sequentially
      with intramuscular G305 over three months. During Part 1, a dose escalation design will be
      utilized in patients with melanoma, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, or sarcoma. After completion of
      Part 1, the study will be expanded in Part 2 and will enroll patients with NSCLC, ovarian
      cancer, synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             burden, which may or may not be measureable (see Appendix A for descriptions)

          2. Tumor histology consistent with one of the following: In Part 1, Dose Escalation -
             melanoma, NSCLC, ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube carcinoma), or sarcoma (any
             subtype). In Part 2, Patient Expansion - NSCLC, ovarian cancer (including fallopian
             tube carcinoma), or the sarcoma subtypes, synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round cell
             liposarcoma

          3. Tumor specimen positive for NY-ESO-1 expression by IHC and/or RT-PCR

          4. If ovarian cancer, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) must be ≥ 40 U/mL (unless patient has
             measureable disease that cannot be followed by CA-125); if melanoma, LDH must be ≤
             ULN

          5. Inadequate response, relapse, and/or unacceptable toxicity with one or more prior
             systemic, surgical, or radiation cancer therapies, and for whom curative standard
             therapy is not an option (except patients with NSCLC who must have experienced either
             an inadequate response, relapse, and/or unacceptable toxicity with two or more prior
             systemic, surgical, or radiation cancer therapies)

          6. ≥ 18 years of age

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial for patients with a solid tumor which has come back, or may come
      back, or has not gone away after treatment, including the standard treatment we know for
      these diseases. This is a study using special immune system cells called tumor-associated
      antigen (TAA)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, a new experimental therapy.

      The proteins that the investigators are targeting in this study are called tumor-associated
      antigens (TAAs). These are cell proteins that are specific to the cancer cell, so they
      either do not show or show up in low quantities on normal human cells. In this study, the
      investigators target five common TAAs called NY-ESO-1, MAGEA4, PRAME, Survivin and SSX. On a
      different study, patients have been treated and so far this treatment has shown to be safe.

      The investigators now want to try this treatment in patients with solid tumors.

      This protocol is designed as a Phase I dose-escalation study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood will be collected from the patient and TAA-specific CTLs will be made.

      The cells will be injected by IV into the patient over 1 - 10 minutes. The patient may be
      pre-treated with acetaminophen (Tylenol) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Acetaminophen
      (Tylenol) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl) are given to prevent a possible allergic reaction
      to the T cell infusion. Initially, two doses of T cells will be given two weeks apart. The
      patient's disease will be assessed pre-infusion and then 6 weeks after the second infusion.
      If after the second infusion there is a reduction in the size of the patient's tumor on CT
      or MRI scan as assessed by a radiologist, the patient can receive up to six (6) additional
      doses of the T cells at monthly intervals if they wish. All of the treatments will be given
      by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Houston Methodist Hospital or Texas Children's
      Hospital.

      In between the first and second T cell infusions, and for 6 weeks after the last infusion,
      the investigators ask that the patient not receive any other anti-cancer treatments such as
      radiation therapy or chemotherapy. If the patient does receive any other therapies
      in-between the first and second infusion of T cells, they will be taken off treatment and
      will not be able to receive the second infusion of T cells.

      This is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started
      on the lowest dose (1 of 4 different levels) of T cells. Once that dose schedule proves
      safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will
      continue until all 4 dose levels are studied. If the side effects are too severe, the dose
      will be lowered or the T cell injections will be stopped.

      Medical tests before treatment:

      Physical exam. Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function. Measurements
      of the patient's tumor by routine imaging studies. The investigators will use the imaging
      study that was previously performed to follow the patient's tumor: Computer Tomogram (CT),
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or Positron Emission Tomography (PET).

      Pregnancy test if the patient is a female who can have children.

      Medical tests during and after treatment:

      Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function. Imaging study 8 weeks after
      the 1st CTL infusion.

      To learn more about the way the T cells are working in the patient's body, an extra 20-40 mL
      (4-8 teaspoons) of blood will be taken before each infusion, and at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6.
      Afterwards, blood will be collected at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the last infusion. The
      investigators will use this blood to see how long the T cells last, and to look at the
      immune response to the patient's response to cancer. Patients will then be contacted once a
      year for up to 4 additional years (total of 5 years follow-up) to evaluate their disease
      response long-term.

    <description>Four different dosing schedules will be evaluated. Two to four patients will be evaluated on each dosing schedule. The first two patients on each dose level will be staggered by 4 weeks (which starts when the first infusion is given, Day 0). The first patient on each dose level will be an adult. No subjects between the ages of 2-18 will be enrolled to a dose level on this protocol until the dose level has been shown to be safe in adults on the lymphoma protocol also being conducted under this same IND. Each patient will receive 2 injections at the same dose,14 days apart, according to the following dosing schedules: The expected volume of infusion will be 1 to 10 cc.

    <description>Patients may be pre-medicated with diphenhydramine (Benadryl) up to 1 mg/kg IV (max 50 mg) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) 10 mg/kg po (max 650 mg), though this is not mandatory.
Cell Administration: Tumor-specific T cells will be given by intravenous injection over 1-10 minutes through either a peripheral or a central line.
If patients with active disease have stable disease or a partial response by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria at their 8 week or subsequent evaluations, they are eligible to receive up to 6 additional doses of CTLs at monthly intervals, each of which will consist of the same cell number as their second injection. Patients will not be able to receive additional doses until the initial safety profile is completed at 6 weeks following the second infusion.</description>

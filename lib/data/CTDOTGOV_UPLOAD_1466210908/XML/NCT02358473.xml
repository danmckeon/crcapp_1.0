          -  Prior therapy must meet all of the following criteria:

               1. Subject has experienced disease progression or unacceptable toxicity/intolerance
                  after receiving at least 1 systemic platinum-containing regimen;

               2. Subject with a tumor of non-squamous histology must be tested for epidermal
                  growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
                  rearrangement. Subject with EGFR activating mutation or ALK rearrangement must
                  have experienced disease progression or unacceptable toxicity/intolerance after
                  receiving at least one EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor or ALK inhibitor;

               3. Subject has received PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or has been informed of the results of
                  relevant positive Phase 3 trials with these agents.

             oral contraceptives, double barrier method (condom plus spermicide or diaphragm plus
             spermicide), or practice true abstinence from sexual intercourse during the study and
             for 3 months after the last dose. Women of child-bearing potential include female
             subjects who have experienced menarche and have not undergone surgical sterilization
             or are not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months without an
             alternative medical cause);

             investigational product and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1 of each Cycle;

          -  Recovered (i.e., Grade ≤ 1 or to a baseline level) from the effects of recent
             surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or other therapies for cancer
             (with the exception of alopecia for which no resolution is required and peripheral
             neuropathy which must have resolved to Grade ≤ 1 for subjects receiving prior
             taxane-based chemotherapy);

          -  Adequate organ function defined as below:

               1. Total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN);

               2. Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9.0 g/dL;

               3. Serum creatinine (sCr) ≤ 1.5 x ULN;

               4. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500 cells/mm3;

               5. Platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L;

          -  Sufficient archived tumor samples (if taken within 6 months prior to treatment may be
             submitted) available for PD assessments, or willingness to undergo a pre-treatment
             core needle biopsy, preferably of the primary tumor, in order to obtain such tissue;

          -  Willing and able to undergo a post-dose core needle biopsy.

      Background:

      LMB-100 is a man-made protein. It is attracted to the mesothelin protein. This is found in
      many tumors, including mesothelioma. But it is found in only a very small number of normal
      tissues. After binding to mesothelin on tumors, LMB-100 attacks and kills cancer cells.
      Researchers want to test LMB-100 in people with advanced mesothelioma.

      Objective:

      To find a safe dose and anti-tumor activity of LMB-100 for people with advanced
      mesothelioma.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 and older with:

      Advanced pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma that has not responded to platinum-based

      therapy

      Adequate organ function

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Samples of tumor tissue or tumor fluid. These can be new or from a previous procedure.

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Chest x-rays

      CT or MRI scans

      FDG-PET scans

      Participants will get LMB-100 on days 1, 3, and 5 of each 21-day cycle. It will be given
      through an IV catheter, a tube inserted in an arm vein. They will get standard medicines
      before each infusion to help prevent side effects. Each infusion lasts about 30 minutes.
      They will be monitored for up to 2 hours after.

      During each cycle, participants will repeat the screening tests.

      Participants will get the study drug for up to 4 cycles or until their disease worsens or
      they have intolerable side effects.

      About 4 6 weeks after their last infusion, participants will have a follow-up visit. They
      will repeat the study tests.

      Participants will have follow-up scans every 6 weeks until their disease gets worse.

      Participants will be called about once a year to see how they are doing.

      Background:

        -  Although mesothelioma patients with a limited tumor burden may benefit from surgical
           resection, most patients have advanced disease at diagnosis and are not candidates for
           cytoreductive surgery.

        -  For mesothelioma patients who are not eligible for curative surgery, the median
           survival with supportive care alone is 6 months whereas with the current standard
           treatment, a combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed, the median survival is 12 months.

        -  Mesothelin, a tumor differentiation antigen, is expressed in over 95% of epitheloid
           mesothelioma. Mesothelin is a suitable candidate for targeted therapy due to its very
           limited expression in normal human tissue and its high expression in several tumors
           including mesothelioma.

        -  LMB-100 is a novel recombinant anti-mesothelin immunotoxin developed for the treatment
           of patients with solid tumors that express mesothelin. Mesothelin is targeted by
           linking a humanized fragment of the anti-mesothelin Fab to a de-immunized Pseudomonas
           exotoxin (PE).

        -  The clinical use of first generation immunotoxins such as SS1P was hampered mainly by
           their high immunogenicity. LMB-100 is a next generation PE-fusion protein that has been
           protein-engineered to maximally reduce its immunogenicity. LMB-100 has shown broad
           activity against different mesothelinexpressing cancer cell lines and tumor xenograft
           models.

      Objectives: Phase 1

      To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LMB-100 in patients with treatment
      refractory advanced epithelioid or biphasic mesothelioma.

      -Phase 2

      To determine the efficacy of LMB-100 with respect to objective response rate in patients
      with treatment refractory advanced epithelioid or biphasic mesothelioma.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  Histologically confirmed advanced pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma

        -  Subjects must have had at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen with last dose of previous
           therapy occurring at 3 weeks before the start of study treatment

        -  Adequate organ function

        -  Participants with CNS metastases or prior pneumonectomy are excluded

      Design:

        -  This is a Phase I, open-label study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and
           activity of LMB-100 in patients with treatment refractory advanced epithelioid or
           biphasic mesothelioma.

        -  LMB-100 will be administered intravenously on days 1, 3 and 5 of each 21 day cycle for
           up to 4 cycles

        -  Tumor response will be assessed after every 2 cycles

        -  Optional tumor biopsies may be collected at baseline and after 2 cycles of therapy

        -  The accrual ceiling will be set at 30

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Histologically confirmed epithelial or biphasic mesothelioma not amenable to
             potentially curative surgical resection. However, patients with biphasic tumors that
             have a more than or equal to 50% sarcomatoid component will be excluded. The
             diagnosis will be confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, CCR, NCI.

          -  Archival sample or fresh biopsy or tumor effusion must be available for confirmation
             of diagnosis.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for
             nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as greater than or equal to 20 mm
             with conventional techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan.

          -  Patients must have had at least one prior chemotherapy regimen that includes
             pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin. There is no limit to the number of prior
             chemotherapy regimens received.

          -  The last dose of previous therapy must have occurred at least 3 weeks prior to the
             start of study therapy. Palliative radiotherapy is allowed up to 2 weeks before the
             first LMB-100 infusion.

          -  Patients for whom no standard curable therapy exists

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of LMB-100 in patients &lt; 18 years of age, children are
             excluded from this study

          -  All acute toxic effects of any prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or surgical
             procedure must have resolved to Grade less than or equal to 1, except alopecia (any
             grade) and Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy.

          -  ECOG performance status (PS) 0 or1

          -  Adequate hematological function: neutrophil count of more than or equal to 1.0
             (SqrRoot) 10(9) cells/microL, platelet count of greater than or equal to
             100,000/microl, hemoglobin more than or equal to 9 g/dL

          -  Adequate liver function: Bilirubin less than or equal to 2.5 (SqrRoot) the upper
             limit of normal (ULN) (excluding Gilbert s Syndrome, see below).

          -  Patients with Gilbert s syndrome will be eligible for the study. The diagnosis of
             Gilbert's syndrome is suspected in people who have persistent, slightly elevated
             levels of unconjugated bilirubin without any other apparent cause. A diagnosis of
             Gilbert s syndrome will be based on the exclusion of other diseases based on the
             following criteria:

               -  Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia noted on several occasions

               -  No evidence of hemolysis (normal hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, and LDH)

               -  Normal liver function tests

               -  Absence of other diseases associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia

          -  Adequate renal function: creatinine clearance (by Cockcroft Gault formula) greater
             than or equal to 50 mL/min.

          -  Must have serum albumin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL without intravenous supplementation

          -  Must have left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 50%

          -  Must have an ambulatory oxygen saturation of &gt; 90% on room air

          -  The effects of LMB-100 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry until
             4

        months (female) or two months (male) after the last dose of study therapy. Should a woman
        become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in
        this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

        -Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
        document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        -Known or clinically suspected CNS primary tumors or metastases including leptomeningeal
        metastases. History or clinical evidence of CNS metastases unless they have been
        previously treated, are asymptomatic, and have had no requirement for steroids or
        enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants in the last 14 days.

        Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases which could affect compliance
        with the protocol or interpretation of results, including significant pulmonary disease
        other than primary cancer, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and/or significant
        cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac
        disease, myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, unstable arrhythmias, unstable
        angina, or clinically significant pericardial effusion)

          -  Active or uncontrolled infections.

          -  HIV or active HBV or HCV infection. HIV positive patients will be excluded due to a
             theoretical concern that the degree of immune suppression associated with the
             treatment may result in progression of HIV infection.

          -  Patients with prior pneumonectomy

          -  Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that would
             contraindicate the use of an investigational drug

          -  Major surgery or significant traumatic injury greater than or equal to 28 days prior
             to the first LMB-100 infusion (excluding biopsies) or anticipation of the need for
             major surgery during study treatment

          -  Dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit informed consent

          -  Live attenuated vaccinations 14 days prior to treatment

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because it is unknown whether LMB-100 has
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of
             the mother with LMB-100, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with LMB-100. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in
             this study.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of LMB-100

          -  High doses of systemic corticosteroids within 7 days prior to first dosing. High dose
             is considered as &gt; 20 mg of dexamethasone a day (or equivalent) for &gt; 7 consecutive
             days.

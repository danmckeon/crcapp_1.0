  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: CRLX101 consists of a sugar molecule cyclodextrin linked to a chemotherapy drug
      called camptothecin. The combined molecule or nanoparticle drug conjugate travels through
      the blood. Once inside cancer cells, the chemotherapy drug is released from the molecule.
      Olaparib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from repairing the DNA damage caused by
      chemotherapy. Researchers want to see how safe it is to give CRLX101 and olaparib together
      and to see how well the combination treats a specific type of lung cancer called small cell
      lung cancer (SCLC).

      Objectives:

      To test the safety and maximum dose of CLRX101 and olaparib together. To test how well they
      treat small cell lung cancer.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18 and older with small cell lung cancer.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with standard cancer care tests.

      Participants will get the 2 study drugs in 28-day cycles. CRLX101 will be given every 2
      weeks, through a small plastic tube in an arm vein. Olaparib will be taken by mouth twice a
      day most days. Participants will keep a pill diary.

      For Cycle 1, participants will have 3 visits. All other cycles will have 2 visits.

      At study visits, participants may have:

      Blood and hair samples taken

      History and Physical exam

      Questions about health and side effects

      Pregnancy test

      Optional tumor biopsy where a piece of tumor is removed by needle after numbing the skin. .

      CT scan

      Injection of CRLX101 (twice per cycle)

      &lt; TAB&gt; Olaparib prescription &lt; TAB&gt;

      Participants will have a follow-up visit 4 weeks after finish taking the drugs. They will
      have a physical exam and blood tests. They may have a tumor biopsy. The study team will call
      the patient every 3 months for follow up after completing the study treatment.

      Background:

        -  Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis.

        -  Although highly responsive to chemotherapy initially, SCLC relapses quickly and becomes
           refractory to treatment within a few months.

        -  The use of PARP inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy builds upon pre-clinical
           data in lung cancer and other cancers supporting the notion that PARP inhibitors
           potentiate the effect of DNA damaging therapies.

        -  Despite their highly synergistic activity in preclinical models, human studies
           combining PARP inhibitors and camptothecins have not translated into clinical benefit
           due to enhanced toxicity with the combination.

        -  One approach to improve ability to combine camptothecins with agents that sensitize
           their activity like PARP inhibitors is to use alternative formulations that minimize
           toxicity to the normal tissues.

        -  CRLX101 is a nanoparticle drug conjugate composed of 20 (S)-camptothecin (a potent and
           highly selective topoisomerase I inhibitor) conjugated to a linear,
           cyclodextrinpolyethylene glycol-based polymer.

        -  Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor indicated as monotherapy in patients with deleterious or
           suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutated advanced ovarian cancer who have been
           treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Olaparib has an established
           safety profile and it is under investigation in a number of different cancers.

      Objectives:

        -  Phase I: To determine the MTD/ recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CRLX101 in
           combination with olaparib in patients with refractory cancers

        -  Phase II: To determine the antitumor activity of olaparib plus CRLX101 with respect to
           progression free survival at 16 weeks separately in SCLC patients with resistant and
           sensitive relapse

      Eligibility:

      Phase I

        -  Male or female adult patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed, advanced solid tumor that is refractory to
           standard therapy and/or for whom no further standard therapy is available

        -  ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2

      Phase II

        -  Male or female patients greater than or equal to 18 years old

        -  Have a pathologically (histology or cytology) confirmed diagnosis of SCLC

        -  Disease progression on or after at least one platinum-based standard chemotherapy
           regimen for either limited or extensive stage disease.

        -  Have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1

        -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2

      Design:

        -  Patients meeting eligibility criteria will receive CRLX101 (IV Q 2weeks) plus olaparib
           (PO BID days 3-13 and days 17-26; On days 13 and 26, only one dose of olaparib will be
           administered in the morning) administered in 28 day cycles, until disease progression
           or development of intolerable side effects. The MTD of the combination will be used in
           Phase II.

        -  Blood, tumor and hair samples will be collected at multiple time points for PK, PD
           analyses. Tumor biopsies are optional and will be performed only in SCLC patients (in
           Phase I and II) at the following time points: pre-treatment, on cycle 1 day 4 and at
           disease progression.

        -  Toxicity will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.0.

        -  Tumor assessments will be made using CT scans (chest, abdomen and pelvis) at baseline
           and after every 2 cycles according to RECIST version 1.1.

        -  After discontinuation of study treatment, follow-up for survival will be carried out
           every 3 months.

        -  The maximum number of patients on the phase I portion of the trial is 30 and the two
           cohorts in phase II may accrue up to 20 evaluable patients each. Thus, the maximum
           number of evaluable patients who may enroll on this trial is 70. In order to allow for
           a small number of in-evaluable patients, the accrual ceiling will be set at 75.

        -  It is anticipated that approximately 1 to 2 patients per month may enroll onto this
           trial; the trial is expect to complete accrual in 3-4 years.

          -  Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study
             medication.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic

        composition to CRLX101 and/or olaparib or other agents used in study.

        - Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong and moderate inhibitors

        or inducers of CYP3A are ineligible.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because CRLX101 and/or olaparib are
             agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is
             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with CRLX101 and/or olaparib, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with CRLX101 and/or olaparib. These potential
             risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with CRLX101 and/or olaparib. In
             addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Prolongation of QT/QTc interval (QTc interval &gt; 500 msec) using the Fredericia method
             of QTc analysis or family history of long QT syndrome. If single reading is above
             these minimum ranges, then repeat test in triplicate and evaluate eligibility based
             on average value

          -  Any chronic or concurrent acute liver disease.

          -  Concurrent treatment with Coumadin. Use of low molecular weight heparin use is
             permitted.

          -  History of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or myocardial infarction, within
             6 months prior to C1D1

          -  Uncontrolled concurrent disease or illness including but not limited to:

               -  symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, clinically
                  significant cardiac arrhythmia

               -  unstable or untreated cardiac conditions or ejection fraction of &lt; 50% as
                  determined by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA)

               -  uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

               -  psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with study requirements, as
                  determined by the Investigator

          -  Other severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration or that may interfere with the interpretation of study results
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for
             the study.

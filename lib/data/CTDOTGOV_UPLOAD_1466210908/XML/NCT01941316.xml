      The purpose of this study is to determine a well-tolerated dose of Carfilzomib in
      combination with Irinotecan in subjects with relapsed small and non-small cell lung cancer
      or other irinotecan-sensitive cancers and to assess the 6 month survival of relapsed small
      cell lung cancer patients treated with this combination therapy.

      Small cell lung cancer accounts for approximately 15% of all lung cancer diagnoses in the
      United States (US), with 60-80% response rates to platinum-based chemotherapy in extensive
      disease. Despite its sensitivity to chemotherapy, small cell lung cancer is characterized by
      extensive disease dissemination at presentation and the overall prognosis remains poor, with
      a 2-year overall survival of less than 5% and a median survival of approximately 9-11
      months. Currently, the only FDA-approved second-line therapies are oral and parenteral
      topotecan, although irinotecan is also commonly used in primary and relapsed disease. Novel
      combination therapies are desperately needed in this disease in order to improve survival.

      Proteasome inhibition affects the levels of numerous cell cycle control proteins, apoptosis,
      cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance proteins. Carfilzomib and other proteasome
      inhibitors interrupt cellular pathways integral to the survival of small cell lung cancer,
      namely the dysregulated apoptotic pathway involving activated nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB).
      NF-kB activates the transcription of anti-apoptotic and proliferation genes, mediating tumor
      cell survival in response to cytotoxic stress and resulting in chemoresistance, a common
      problem in small cell lung cancer. Carfilzomib prevents proteasomal degradation of IkB, the
      inhibitor of NF-kB, and also modulates levels of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 and the tumor
      suppressor p53. Overexpression of Bcl-2, a key mediator of resistance to apoptosis following
      chemotherapy, is an important problem in SCLC, the vast majority of SCLC cases have bcl-2
      overexpression, and low levels of bcl-2 and b1-integrin are associated with improved
      survival in SCLC.

      Topoisomerase-1 is thought to cause apoptosis via mechanisms other than NF-kB, adding to the
      potential synergy of these compounds. In addition, topoisomerase-1 is overexpressed in the
      majority of subjects with SCLC and decreased degradation of this enzyme is expected to lead
      to further enhancement of this mechanism of apoptosis.

      Irinotecan, a camptothecins, inhibits topoisomerase I. As a class, camptothecins have shown
      efficacy in small cell lung cancer in a variety of settings. The pivotal phase III study
      which led to FDA approval of topotecan in relapsed small cell lung cancer was by Von Pawel
      et al, and included 211 subjects with sensitive (&gt; 60 days since prior therapy) relapse and
      randomized them to either topotecan (107 subjects) daily for 5 days or to cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin, and vincristine (CAV), each given every 21 days. Topotecan showed no
      significant improvement in the median time to progression (13.3 weeks vs.12.3 weeks,
      p=0.552) or median survival (25 weeks vs. 24.7 weeks, p=0.795), however, subjects treated
      with topotecan had improvement in cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, hoarseness, anorexia,
      and fatigue) as well as hematologic toxicity. Irinotecan, has established activity in small
      cell lung cancer, as well as non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer and ovarian
      cancer. Le Chevalier and colleagues used an every 3-week schedule of irinotecan, 350 mg/m2,
      given to 32 chemotherapy-naive SCLC subjects and showed an objective response rate of 16%
      and a median survival of 4.5 months. Thus, the median survival of camptothecins in the
      second -line setting in SCLC ranges from 24 to 35 weeks, with those subjects in sensitive
      relapse having a median survival of 4 to 8 weeks longer than those with refractory relapse.
      The use of Carfilzomib in combination with Irinotecan, a topoisomerase inhibitor, is
      expected to differ from previous efforts with other proteasome inhibitors because of its
      sustained proteasome inhibition and its potential synergy with this class of drugs.

      For Phase 1b patients will be entered onto dosing cohorts of 3 patients. At least three
      patients at each dose level must have completed cycle one before the study leadership
      (principal investigators and Study statisticians) will allow patients to be enrolled onto
      the successive dose level.

      Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be defined according to the National Cancer Institute's
      CTCAE v.4.0 toxicity scale.

      For Phase 2 patients will be treated with the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Carfilzomib
      determined in Phase 1b and 125mg/m2 of Irinotecan.

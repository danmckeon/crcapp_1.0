    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving erlotinib (Tarceva) with or without
      bevacizumab (Avastin) works in treating patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Erlotinib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Bevacizumab
      blocks the ability of tumors to grow new blood vessels and spread. It is not yet known
      whether erlotinib is more effective when given alone or with bevacizumab.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the progression-free survival of erlotinib (erlotinib)
      and bevacizumab versus that of erlotinib alone for the purpose of deciding if the
      combination arm is worth pursuing in a phase III trial. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To
      investigate the overall survival of erlotinib and bevacizumab versus erlotinib alone. II. To
      investigate the response rate of erlotinib and bevacizumab versus erlotinib alone. III. To
      investigate the progression-free survival in patients with exon deletion 19 or exon 21 L858R
      EGFR point mutations. IV. To investigate the toxicity of erlotinib and bevacizumab versus
      erlotinib alone using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To correlate EGFR mutations detected in plasma deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) with those detected in tumor DNA. II. To estimate the prevalence of EGFR T790M
      resistance mutations from pretreatment tumor biopsies using more sensitive mutation
      detection methods. III. To investigate progression free survival of EGFR mutant NSCLC
      patients with and without concurrent EGFR T790M detected from pre-treatment tumor specimen
      using allele specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). IV. To prospectively
      evaluate the predictive value of plasma vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) levels
      on progression free survival in patients treated with erlotinib alone or in combination with
      bevacizumab. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients
      receive erlotinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. ARM B: Patients receive
      erlotinib as in Arm A and bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. In
      both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up
      periodically for up to 5 years.

    <description>Described graphically using the Kaplan and Meier product limit estimator. Comparisons of PFS between arms will be conducted using a stratified log rank test. Cox proportional hazards model will be used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals.

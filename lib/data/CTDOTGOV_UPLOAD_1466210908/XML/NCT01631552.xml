  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IMMU-132 as a single
      agent administered in 3-week treatment cycles for up to 8 cycles, in previously treated
      patients with advanced epithelial cancer.The secondary objectives are to obtain initial data
      concerning pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and efficacy with this dosing regimen. IMMU-132
      targets the TROP-2 antigen which is expressed on a variety of cancers. The antibody, RS7, is
      attached to SN38, which is the active metabolite of irinotecan. This is planned as a
      multi-center study. In Phase II, up to 130 patients (assessable) in triple-negative breast
      cancer, up to 100 patients (assessable) in non-small cell and small-cell lung cancer and up
      to 50 patients (assessable) per other cancer types included in the protocol will be studied
      at the 10 mg/kg dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, open-label study of IMMU-132 in previously treated patients with
      advanced epithelial cancers, including ovarian, breast, prostate (hormone refractory), lung
      (non-small cell and small cell), head &amp; neck (squamous cell), esophageal, gastric,
      colorectal, pancreatic, hepatocellular, renal (clear cell), endometrial, cervical,
      urothelial, thyroid cancers and glioblastoma multiforme. Patients receive IMMU-132
      administered once-weekly for the first 2 weeks of 3-week treatment cycles. Patients may
      receive up to a maximum total of 8 cycles (16 doses), but patients with a partial response
      or stable disease at that time, or patients who had achieved an objective response but
      relapsed after discontinuing treatment, may continue to be treated based on physician
      discretion. Treatment will continue until unacceptable toxicity or progression of disease.
      Both safety and efficacy will be assessed.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the clinical trial is to investigate safety and tolerability of
      escalating doses of OBI-833/OBI-821 in subjects with metastatic incurable solid tumors, such
      as gastric, lung,colorectal or breast cancer. Meanwhile, the humoral immune responses,
      i.e.,anti-Globo H IgG and IgM production following administration of OBI-833/OBI-821 will be
      assessed as the secondary objective of this study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The First-In-Human clinical trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability of three doses
      of OBI-833 (10,30 and 100μg) along with a fixed dose of 100μg OBI-821 adjuvent in a small
      number of patients (N=26) with late stage gastric, colorectal, breast and lung cancers.
      Patients will receive a total 10 doses subcutaneously over 24 weeks, and will be evaluated
      for safety and immune response during the 24 week treatment period and subsequently observed
      for additional 12 weeks post-treatment. In addition to the standard battery of safety tests,
      evaluations will also include immunological response, tumor markers and clinical endpoints
      such as disease or progression free survival (RECIST 1.1).

    <description>Single Arm. Each subject will be given a total of 10 doses of OBI-833/OBI-821 subcutaneously at weeks 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,16,20,and 24 (Visits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 10, respectively). Post treatment, subjects will be continually evaluated for safety and immune response every 4 weeks until the end of study, which is 12 weeks after the last dose, i.e., week 36. Subsequently, subjects will be followed for survival every 8 weeks up to 12 months after the end of study.</description>

          2. Subjects with metastatic incurable gastric, lung, colorectal or breast cancer who
             have achieved stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR)
             status after at least 1 regimen of anticancer therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, hormonal
             or targeted therapy, either alone or in any combination).

          3. Performance status: ECOG ≤ 1

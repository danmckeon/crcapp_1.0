  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This screening study is intended for men and women at least 18 years of age who have
      advanced or metastatic lung cancer. The study will assess a subject's tumor antigen
      expression profile and HLA subtype. Based on the results, it will be determined if a subject
      can then enroll into an Adaptimmune-sponsored clinical trial which will test the safety of
      genetically changed T cells and find out what effects, if any, they have in subjects with
      lung cancer. No treatment intervention will occur as part of this screening study.

      Upon enrollment, subjects will provide a tumor tissue sample and a blood sample for testing.
      The tumor sample will be sent to a central laboratory to test for tumor gene or protein,
      which may include, but are not limited to NY-ESO-1, MAGE A10, and others. The blood sample
      will be sent to a local laboratory and tested for HLA subtype.

      Following screening for eligibility into a clinical trial(s), tumor samples will be kept by
      Adaptimmune for the purpose of developing and validating a diagnostic assay(s) for antigen
      expression profiling.

  <detailed_description>

      This multicenter screening study will be conducted in order to determine a subject's tumor
      antigen expression profile and HLA subtype, and subsequent eligibility for
      Adaptimmune-sponsored clinical treatment trials studying the safety and efficacy of
      autologous genetically modified T-cells with engineered with enhanced TCRs targeting
      specific antigens. No treatment intervention will occur as part of this screening study.

      For this screening study, subjects with confirmed NSCLC will be required to provide a tumor
      specimen and a blood sample for diagnostic analysis. The tumor biopsy will be screened at a
      central reference laboratory for the expression (gene or protein) of multiple antigens. The
      antigens to be screened may include, but are not limited to the following: NY-ESO-1, MAGE
      A10, and others to be determined. The blood sample will be used for HLA subtype analysis.
      Based upon both the tumor antigen expression and the HLA subtype, if eligible, subjects will
      be referred to appropriate available clinical treatment trial(s) at the discretion of the
      investigator.

      The secondary objective of the study is the development and validation of companion
      diagnostic assay(s) for antigen expression profiling. Therefore, following screening for
      eligibility onto a treatment trial(s), all tumor specimens will be retained by Adaptimmune
      for companion diagnostic validation purposes.

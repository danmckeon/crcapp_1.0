  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of abemaciclib in
      combination with another anti-cancer drug in participants with NSCLC that is advanced or has
      spread to other parts of the body (stage IV). The study will also investigate how the body
      processes the combination treatment and how the study drug affects the body. The study will
      also collect disease-related symptoms and participant-reported pain related to NSCLC.

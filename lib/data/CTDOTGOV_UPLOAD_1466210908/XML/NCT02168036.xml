  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to obtain biologic materials from the mediastinal lymph
      nodes from patients with lung disease and mediastinal lymph node involvement in order to:
      (1) develop a better understanding of the cause and development of lung disorders involving
      the mediastinal lymph nodes; (2) identify biologic parameters that help diagnose and predict
      the behavior of human lung diseases; and (3) identify individuals who will be suitable
      candidates for other protocols such as those involving investigational new drugs.

      This study will use bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle
      aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) as part of their diagnostic work up as recommended by the treating
      physician. The procedure will be performed as standard of care, either under general
      anesthesia in the operating room or in the bronchoscopy suite under moderate sedation and
      analgesia. Bronchoscopy with EBUS-TBNA is normally an ambulatory procedure. During the
      procedure, biopsy needle will be passed through the tube and a small sample will be taken
      for both diagnostic and research purposes. Samples collected for diagnostic purposes will be
      sent to the Department of Pathology. Additional biopsy samples will be collected for
      research purposes. The subject is observed after the bronchoscopy, including vital signs and
      level of consciousness, until they are back to baseline. All subjects will be discharged
      with an escort as per Hospital policy. An overnight stay would be required for ambulatory
      individuals only if the individual is not, in the judgment of the treating attending
      physician, safe to be discharged as is standard practice.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1b, 2 Part (Part 1a and Part 1b), multi-center study.

      Part 1a utilizes a 3+3 design to evaluate pembrolizumab and INCB combinations in advanced
      solid tumors. Group A will evaluate a JAK inhibitor with JAK1 selectivity (INCB039110) in
      combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and Group B will evaluate a PI3K-delta inhibitor
      (INCB050465) in combination with pembrolizumab to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      or PAD and recommend a dose for the Part 1b safety expansion with each combination.

      Once the recommended dose has been identified in Part 1a, subjects with select solid tumor
      types will be enrolled into safety expansion cohorts based upon prior treatment history with
      a PD-1 pathway-targeted agent (Part 1b) for each combination.

      MMR-deficient tumors, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma, triple negative breast cancer, or transitional cell carcinoma of
      the genitourinary tract will be enrolled into safety expansion cohorts based upon prior
      treatment history with a PD-1 pathway-targeted agent (Part 1b) for each combination.

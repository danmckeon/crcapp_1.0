      This clinical trial compares fluorine F 18 L-glutamate derivative BAY94-9392 (18F-FSPG)
      positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to the standard of care
      fluorodeoxyglucose F-18 (18F-FDG) PET/CT in imaging patients with newly diagnosed lung
      cancer or indeterminate pulmonary nodules. PET/CT uses a radioactive glutamate (one of the
      common building blocks of protein) called 18F-FSPG which may be able to recognize
      differences between tumor and healthy tissue. Since tumor cells are growing, they need to
      make protein, and other building blocks, for cell growth that are made from glutamate and
      other molecules. PET/CT using a radioactive glutamate may be a more effective method of
      diagnosing lung cancer than the standard PET/CT using a radioactive glucose (sugar), such as
      18F-FDG.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the imaging characteristics of 18F-FSPG PET/CT with standard-of-care, 18F-FDG
      PET/CT.

      II. To compare the imaging characteristics of 18F-FSPG PET/CT to standard-of-care 18F-FDG
      PET/CT in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer.

      III. To determine whether 18F-FSPG uptake in lung cancer can be predicted based on
      correlation with CD44 and amino acid transport system xc- (xC-) expression in surgical
      pathology specimens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 18F-FDG PET/CT scan per standard of care. Within 15 working days, patients
      also undergo 18F-FSPG PET scan over 60 minutes followed by an 18F-FSPG PET/CT scan over 30
      minutes.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 2 years if needed for diagnosis.

             Services Task Force (USPSTF) eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening, with a
             newly discovered indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPN) (7-30 mm diameter) on CT
             (newly seen on medical imaging, without prior examinations to demonstrate that the
             lesion has been stable for two or more years), untreated

               -  USPSTF eligibility criteria:

                    -  The patient is aged 40 to 80 years of age, AND

                    -  Has a 30 or more pack-year history of smoking, AND

                    -  Currently smokes, or, if the patient has quit smoking, has quit within the
                       last 15 years, or

          -  An adult patient with a newly diagnosed, untreated primary lung cancer, with a

          -  The patient's inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (such as due to
             cough, severe arthritis), as assessed upon pre-enrollment screening, will not be
             enrolled

          -  A recognized active lung infection

          -  Previous systemic or radiation treatment for cancer of any type within 2 years

             treated, as determined by the potential subjects' treating physician

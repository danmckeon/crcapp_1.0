  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an efficacy and safety study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) combined with
      platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy versus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy alone in
      participants with advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who
      have not previously received systemic therapy for advanced disease. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab combined with pemetrexed and platinum
      (Investigators choice of cisplatin or carboplatin), OR pemetrexed and platinum
      (Investigators choice of cisplatin or carboplatin).

      The primary hypothesis is that pembrolizumab in combination with platinum-pemetrexed
      chemotherapy prolongs Progression Free Survival (PFS) compared to platinum-pemetrexed
      chemotherapy alone.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of an investigational agent,
      P10s-PADRE, a peptide mimotope-based vaccine, in patients of all races with stage IV
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer who have completed their primary chemotherapy without
      progressing, and who still have measurable residual disease.

      A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial is designed with the goal being to
      evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine. Efficacy will be based primarily on the tumor
      response, and secondarily on progression-free survival. Information on safety and
      tolerability will be collected. Humoral and cellular immune responses will be analyzed.

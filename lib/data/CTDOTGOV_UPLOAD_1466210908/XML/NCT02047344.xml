  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label, Phase II study in KRAS-positive and KRAS-negative patients
      with stage IV (including pleural effusion) non squamous NSCLC who have failed two lines of
      anti-cancer therapy. A maximum of 60 evaluable patients with NSCLC will receive
      antroquinonol, of which 30 patients will be KRAS-positive and 30 patients KRAS-negative. An
      evaluable patient will have received at least one dose of antroquinonol and have a valid
      baseline tumor assessment. Enrollment will continue until the target number of evaluable
      patients has been enrolled.

      1. Progression free survival rate at 12 weeks, defined as the proportion of patients alive
           and progression free at Week 12. Patients will be progression free if they have no
           tumor assessments of progressive disease (defined according to RECIST guidelines,
           version 1.1) at any point from the start of treatment to Week 12.

        2. Objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients whose best overall
           response is either CR or PR according to RECIST version 1.1. The best overall response
           is the best response recorded during the first 12 week treatment cycle.

        3. Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of patients with a documented CR,
           PR and SD during the first 12 week treatment cycle according to RECIST version 1.1.

        4. Duration of overall tumor response (DR), defined as the interval between the date of
           the first observation of tumor response (CR or PR) and the date of disease progression
           or death.

        5. Progression free survival defined as the time from randomization to objective tumor
           progression by RECIST version 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

        6. Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause.

        7. Time to progression (TTP) defined as the time from randomization to objective tumor
           progression by RECIST version 1.1.

    <description>Tumor response will be assessed at 6 week intervals during the first treatment cycle using the RECIST criteria, version 1.1. Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories: 1) complete response (CR), 2) partial response (PR), 3) stable disease (SD), or 4) progressive disease (PD). Patients who died from any cause or discontinued the study for any reason without a post screening or Week 12 tumor assessment will be considered as failing to respond to treatment.</description>

    <description>PK sampling will be performed on Days 0 and 28 in all patients enrolled in Stage 1. Sparse PK sampling will be performed on Days 28, 42, and 56 in all patients enrolled in Stage 2.
PK endpoints will be derived for intensively sampled PK profiles by non compartmental methods and include:
Cmax: peak concentration;Ctrough: trough plasma concentration; Tmax: peak time;AUC: area under the plasma concentration time curve over the 8 hour dosing interval;T½: terminal half life;Vz/F: apparent volume of distribution during elimination;CL/F: apparent oral clearance;T½, eff: effective half life.</description>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a Phase 1-2, open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation and
      cohort-expansion study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and
      antitumor activity of daily oral administration of eFT508.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      eFT508 is an oral, potent and highly selective inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase
      interacting kinase (MNK) 1 and 2. Dysregulated translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) plays a
      role in the pathogenesis of multiple solid tumors and hematological malignancies. MNK1 and
      MNK2 integrate signals from several oncogenic and immune signaling pathways (including RAS,
      p38 and Toll-like receptors) by phosphorylating eukaryotic initiation of factor 4E (eIF4E)
      and key effector proteins. Phosphorylation of these regulatory proteins by MNK1 and MNK2
      selectively regulates the stability and translation of a subset of cellular mRNA that
      control tumor growth, the tumor microenvironment and immune signaling. Nonclinical studies
      indicate that eFT508 shows activity against various types of solid tumors. These nonclinical
      studies support initiation of clinical development of eFT508 in patients with cancer.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotheses:

      Short-term - Targeted therapy with erlotinib or crizotinib plus PART (Personalized Adaptive
      Radiation Therapy) will be safe and will yield favorable outcomes in patients with stage
      III, EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) + or ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) + NSCLC
      (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer).

      Long-term - In patients with stage III NSCLC harboring driver mutations, treatment with
      relevant targeted agents plus PART will improve both local-regional and systemic tumor
      control resulting in improved survival relative to standard chemoradiotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed trial is a pilot study that will accrue 30 patients with inoperable stage
      IIIA/B NSCLC harboring either an EGFR mutation (n=20) or an ALK rearrangement (n=10).
      Patients with EGFR+ tumors will be treated with erlotinib 150 mg orally QD; patients with
      ALK+ tumors will be treated with crizotinib 250 mg orally BID. Treatment consists of six
      weeks of concurrent PART plus erlotinib or crizotinib, followed by erlotinib or crizotinib
      for a total of 1 year. All patients will be treated with response-driven PART with dose
      intensified to the active (FDG-avid) region based on a mid-treatment FDG-PET/CT scan while
      maintaining dose limits for organs-at-risk. The primary endpoints will be PFS and OS.
      Primary analyses will be performed separately for ALK+ and EGFR+ patients. The secondary
      endpoint of treatment-related toxicity will focus on pneumonitis and esophagitis with a
      strict stopping rule in place.

      Current standard therapy affords suboptimal outcomes for patients with locally advanced
      NSCLC due to both locoregional and distant recurrences. Since targeted therapy is more
      effective than chemotherapy in patients with relevant driver mutations, the best way to
      significantly improve outcomes in this subgroup of patients is to optimize systemic therapy
      with targeted agents while improving local control with PET-adapted, high-dose RT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with FDG-avid (radioactive glucose) and pathologically proven stage IIA-IIB
             or IIIA-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer (according to AJCC [American Joint Committee
             on Cancer] staging, 7th edition).

             rearrangement.

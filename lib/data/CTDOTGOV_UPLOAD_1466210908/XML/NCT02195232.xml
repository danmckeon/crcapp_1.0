    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a drug called isoquercetin to prevent venous thrombosis
      (blood clots), in participants who have pancreas, non small cell lung cancer or colorectal
      cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This research study is a Phase II/III clinical trial.

           --The goal of this trial is to evaluate if isoquercetin can prevent blood clots in
           patients with pancreas, non small cell lung cancer or colorectal cancer. In the Phase
           II part of this study, the investigators are looking for the dose of isoquercetin to
           reduce D-dimer and demonstrate safety.

        -  Phase III Endpoint and Treatment Plan

             -  Primary Endpoint for Phase III portion of protocol: Cumulative incidence of VTE at
                56 days.

             -  Following the completion of the phase II portion, enrolled patients will be
                randomized 1:1 to Arm C (isoquercetin) or Arm D (placebo). The dose for Arm C will
                be determined after evaluation of the Phase II portion of the trial. The protocol
                will be amended when the decision is made whether to proceed to Phase III and what
                dose to use for Arm C. The study will be double-blinded to treatment arm. Lower
                extremity ultrasound will be performed at 56 days. Baseline D-dimer and
                correlative labs will be drawn at Day 1 and at 56 days. Patients will be followed
                for survival after completion of 56 days.

             -  At BIDMC, optional blood draw will be performed at time 0 and 4 hours following
                the first dose of study drug.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible
             to participate in phase 2 and 3 of the study:

          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or
             currently unresectable.

          -  Eligible malignancies include:

               -  Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (locally advanced or metastatic)

               -  Colorectal (stage IV)

               -  Non-small cell lung cancer (currently unresectable stage III or stage IV)

          -  Receiving or scheduled to receive first or second line chemotherapy (within 4 weeks)

          -  Minimum age 18 years. Because limited dosing or adverse event data are currently
             available on the use of isoquercetin in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are
             excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric isoquercetin
             trials.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 4 months.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2 (see Appendix B ).

          -  Participants must have preserved organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL

               -  Platelets ≥ 90,000/mcL

               -  PT and PTT ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl

               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine &lt;
                  2.0 mg/dl

          -  The effects of isoquercetin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
             reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
             study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants may not be receiving any other study agents.

          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse
             events.

          -  Prior history of documented venous thromboembolic event within the last 5 years
             (excluding central line associated events whereby patients completed
             anticoagulation).

          -  Active bleeding or high risk for bleeding (e.g. known acute gastrointestinal ulcer)

          -  History of significant hemorrhage (requiring hospitalization or transfusion) outside
             of a surgical setting within the last 24 months

          -  Familial bleeding diathesis

          -  Known diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

          -  Currently receiving anticoagulant therapy

          -  Current daily use of aspirin (&gt;81mg daily), Clopidogrel (Plavix), cilostazol
             (Pletal), aspirin-dipyridamole (Aggrenox) (within 10 days) or considered to use
             regular use of higher doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents as determined
             by the treating physician (e.g ibuprofen &gt; 800 mg daily or equivalent).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Known intolerance of niacin or ascorbic acid (including known G6PD deficiency)

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because isoquercetin is a PDI inhibitor
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with isoquercetin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with isoquercetin. These potential risks may also apply to
             other agents used in this study.

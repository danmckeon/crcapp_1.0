      The MIDAS study aims to follow women with LAM who are currently taking, have previously
      failed or been intolerant of, or are considering treatment with mTOR inhibitors sirolimus or
      everolimus as part of their clinical care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is an uncommon disease affecting women. It is associated with
      cystic lung destruction and progressive respiratory failure. The Multicenter International
      LAM Efficacy of Sirolimus (MILES) Trial, led by the investigators' research team,
      demonstrated that mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibition with sirolimus was an
      effective therapy that stabilized decline in FEV1 (forced expiratory volume). However, lung
      function decline resumed when the drug was stopped at the one year point in MILES,
      suggesting that therapy is suppressive rather than remission-inducing, and may need to be
      lifelong. The investigators therefore need to know whether long-term therapy with sirolimus
      is safe and effective. To accomplish this goal, the investigators will conduct the
      Multicenter International Durability and Safety of Sirolimus in LAM Trial (MIDAS). This is
      an observational &quot;registry&quot; trial. The investigators propose to enroll 300 LAM patients who
      are on, have previously failed or been intolerant of or are considering taking sirolimus or
      everolimus for clinical reasons in a longitudinal observational study. This registry will
      follow lung function tests and adverse events over periods of at least 2 years. The mTOR
      inhibitor therapy will be initiated and managed by the participant's clinician. The study is
      planned to use the collected data from standard of care. This study will help us to refine
      treatment for patients with LAM and determine if long term suppressive therapy with
      sirolimus can prevent progression to later stages of disease. This research will be
      accomplished as part of the Rare Lung Disease Clinical Network Consortium, with data stored
      and analyzed by the Database Management Coordinating Center (DMCC) as part of the
      NIH-supported Rare Disease Consortium.

    <textblock>
      Surgical removal of tumor at an early stage remains the primary treatment for most cancers.
      However, there is currently no reliable screening blood test for detection of lung, colon,
      or breast cancer. The Specific Aims are to: 1) assess the diagnostic accuracy of six FFA
      metabolites to detect lung and colon cancer in surgical patients; 2)determine the rate and
      extent to which FFA metabolites decrease over time after surgery for lung and colon cancer;
      and, 3)determine the positive and negative predictive values and overall test accuracy for
      diagnostic prostate and breast biopsies.

        Prostate cancer occurs only in men; conversely, breast cancer is almost exclusively a
        disease of women. The non-cancer control patients for each type of cancer will be of the
        same sex. We propose to study roughly comparable numbers of prostate and breast cancer
        patients (and controls). Colon and lung cancers occur at similar rates in men and women.
        We thus expect that about half of our total enrollment will be female.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who have early stages of breast cancer prior to surgery potential prostate
             cancer lung cancer colon cancer

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1) Patients will be excluded from enrollment if they have severe liver disease (ALT
             three times the upper limit of normal). Patients will also be excluded who have taken
             aspirin or COX inhibitors within 48 hours of surgery. 2) Patients will be excluded if
             a pathologic diagnosis is already available,from a previous needle biopsy
             (coordinator will remain blinded). 3) Patients will be excluded have received
             pre-procedure chemotherapy or radiotherapy

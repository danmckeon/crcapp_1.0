  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the recommended dose of MK-8628 for further studies in
      participants with advanced nuclear protein in testis (NUT) midline carcinoma (NMC), triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or castration-resistant
      prostate cancer (CRPC). The recommended dose will be established by evaluating dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT), safety, discontinuation, and early efficacy.

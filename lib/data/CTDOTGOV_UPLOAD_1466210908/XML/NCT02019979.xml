      Metformin is thought to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a major sensor of
      cellular energy levels and a key enzyme limiting cellular growth during times of cellular
      stress. Once activated, this enzyme restricts anabolic processes such as protein,
      cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis and inhibits mTOR, a protein kinase responsible for
      unregulated growth. MTOR is upregulated in a variety of tumors, including NSCLC providing
      rationale to take advantage of this pathway with metformin.

      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality in both men and women. In the
      U.S. alone, an estimated 160,340 lung cancer related deaths occurred in 2012, accounting for
      about 28% of all cancer related deaths. Approximately 85% of lung cancer is classified as
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with roughly two-thirds of these patients presenting with
      advanced disease. Histologically, NSCLC can be subdivided into adenocarcinoma, squamous
      cell, large cell, and non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be further classified. Those
      tumors that are not squamous (adenocarcinoma, large cell, not classified) are collectively
      termed as non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NS-NSCLC) and account for roughly 75% of
      all non small cell cancer cases.

      The most accepted upfront treatment for patients with advanced stage NSCLC has been platinum
      based chemotherapy. Current standard practice for treatment of stage IV non-squamous NSCLC
      patients with cytotoxic chemotherapy has evolved over the past decade. In a sentinel study
      in 2005, Sandler and colleagues demonstrated that the addition of bevacizumab to platinum
      doublet chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) followed by maintenance bevacizumab conferred
      a survival advantage when compared to platinum doublet chemotherapy alone (12.1 mos vs. 10.
      mos) in patients with stage IV non squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. Following this, the
      largest phase III study ever conducted in stage IV NSCLC randomized more than 1700 patients
      with stage IV lung cancer to either cisplatin/pemetrexed or cisplatin/gemcitabine. This
      study was the first to reveal an interaction between chemotherapy and
      histology,demonstrating a survival advantage for the subset of patients with non-squamous
      cell treated with cisplatin/pemetrexed when compared to those treated with
      cisplatin/gemcitabine (11.0 vs 10 mos, p&lt;0.05. Building upon this, a recent study evaluating
      maintenance pemetrexed (continuing treatment after the four cycles of platinum doublet
      therapy) in non-squamous cell lung cancer demonstrated a significant survival advantage for
      patients receiving maintenance pemetrexed vs. placebo after four cycles of
      cisplatin/pemetrexed (13.9 mos vs. 11.0 mos, p&lt;0.05). Based on these studies, a regimen of
      cisplatin or carboplatin with pemetrexed followed by maintenance single agent pemetrexed has
      become one of the most accepted frontline treatments for patients with stage IV
      non-squamous, non small cell carcinoma.

      Recently, there has been a firmer understanding of the relevant signaling pathways critical
      for lung cancer growth, leading to the development of novel, targeted therapies. The
      discovery of the EGFR and ALK pathways in lung cancer and the subsequent development of
      drugs that target these pathways, erlotinib and crizotinib respectively, has yielded
      unprecedented survival times in stage IV non-squamous, non small cell lung cancer.
      Unfortunately, only 25 to 30% of patients harbor these mutations, and platinum based
      chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for the 60-70% of patients with stage IV
      disease without identifiable targets. In attempts to improve outcome, a large need remains
      to develop novel, effective agents to combine with platinum therapy that possess a favorable
      toxicity profile at a reasonable cost.

      Metformin:

      Metformin, an oral biguanide agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes
      mellitus, is now prescribed to more than 120 million people worldwide. Its glucose lowering
      effects result from both inhibition of liver gluconeogenesis and increased insulin
      sensitivity in peripheral tissue. Metformin has limited adverse effects with little or no
      risk of hypoglycemia in healthy, nondiabetic controls. In addition to its anti-diabetic
      properties, metformin has demonstrated both chemopreventative and therapeutic effects in
      both prostate and breast cancer. Jiralersprong et al reported that diabetic patients with
      breast cancer receiving metformin had a 24% complete pathological response rate to
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to only 8% of those in the non-metformin group. More
      recently Joshua et al reported reduced tumor Ki-67 rate as well as significant reductions in
      fasting glucose, insulin growth factor 1 and BMI (body mass index) in prostate cancer
      patients receiving neoadjuvant metformin prior to radical prostatectomy. Large
      epidemiological studies consistently have shown substantially lower incidence of cancer
      occurrence and death in diabetic patients taking metformin compared to those receiving other
      therapies. Most recently, a retrospective study of patients with ovarian cancer found that
      5-year disease-specific survival was significantly better for diabetic patients who took
      metformin than for those who did not (67% vs 47%; P = .007). Based on these important
      observational studies, there are currently several, ongoing prospective studies evaluating
      metformin in nondiabetic patients with both early stage and late stage breast cancer and
      prostate cancer, respectively.

      The role of metformin as a preventative and therapeutic agent in lung cancer is beginning to
      be assessed. A recent epidemiological study from Taiwan demonstrated a 39-45% decreased risk
      of lung cancer in diabetic patients being treated with antidiabetic drugs including
      metformin versus those not taking these agents. These studies have triggered preclinical and
      clinical observational trials that further support metformin's potential as an
      antineoplastic agent. In a recent in vitro study, Ashinuma et al. was able to demonstrate
      inhibited clonogenicity, cell growth and proliferation in four different human lung cancer
      cell lines exposed to variable concentrations of metformin. These and other preclinical data
      have triggered in vivo experiments in mice. Memmott and colleagues showed that oral
      administration of 1 or 5mg/mL of metformin decreased lung tumor burden by 38% and 53%
      respectively in A/J mice injected with tobacco carcinogen
      4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1 byutanone (NNK). Importantly, steady state levels of
      metformin were similar to those achieved in diabetic patients using metformin, suggesting
      the treatment and prevention of lung cancer could be achieved with standard oral dosing.
      Finally, two observational studies in humans have reinforced metformin's potential role as a
      therapeutic agent in lung cancer. In the first, Mezzone et al. showed that diabetic patients
      with lung cancer previously treated with metformin or thiazolidinediones had a lower
      incidence of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis and a reduced risk of death
      compared to those who did not receive the same treatment. More recently, a retrospective
      study performed by Tan et al. evaluated the outcomes of three groups of diabetic patients
      with NSCLC treated with first line chemotherapy and receiving various diabetic drugs. In
      this study, patients treated with chemotherapy with metformin had superior outcomes compared
      to those patients treated with chemotherapy with insulin or with drugs other than metformin
      (OS, 20 months vs. 13.1 months vs 13.0 months, respectively, p=0.007). The remarkable
      activity of this agent in both preclinical and clinical lung cancer models as well as its
      low toxicity and tolerability in non diabetic patients warrants further prospective studies
      evaluating the therapeutic efficacy with platinum based chemotherapy in NSCLC.

      Metformin's Biological Effects:

      A nascent understanding of metformin's biological effect on malignant cells may provide
      explanation to the aforementioned preclinical and clinical observations and solidifies the
      basis for further clinical exploration. Preclinical models suggest a variety of mechanism
      including inhibition of &quot;energy sensing&quot; pathways involved in cellular growth, interference
      with the IGF1-insulin axis and blockade of VEGF. Metformin is thought to activate
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a major sensor of cellular energy levels and a key
      enzyme limiting cellular growth during times of cellular stress. Once activated, this enzyme
      restricts anabolic processes such as protein, cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis and
      inhibits mTOR, a protein kinase responsible for dysregulated growth. MTOR is upregulated in
      a variety of tumors, including NSCLC providing rationale to exploit this pathway with
      metformin. Secondly, metformin reverses hyperinsulinemia leading to down regulation of
      insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). These factors are associated with malignant and
      non-malignant tumorogenesis via their aberrant activation of PI3K/Akt pathway, a well known
      pathway that contributes to tumorigenesis. Finally, metabolic reprogramming from oxidative
      phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, is a hallmark of cancer
      cells that constitutes an undisputed advantage in tumor growth. Despite this glycolytic
      shift, some malignant cells retain the capacity to continue oxidative phosphorylation for
      energy production which may enhance malignant potential. In vivo models indicate that
      metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I thereby suppressing oxidative phosphorylation
      which may force cells to engage in survival processes like autophagy leading to eventual
      cell death. In summary, metformin's inhibition of tumor cell growth by disrupting both the
      MTOR and insulin pathways by AMP kinase activation represents a novel way to treat lung
      cancer.

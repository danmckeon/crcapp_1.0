  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, dose escalation study of ABBV-075 in participants with
      advanced cancer to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose of
      ABBV-075. In addition the study will evaluate the safety. tolerability and the
      pharmacokinetics of ABBV-075 and will evaluate differing schedules of administration.

    <description>Maximum tolerated dose is defined as the highest dose level at which less than 2 of 6 participants experience the same dose limiting toxicity. If more than 2 participants experience a different dose limiting toxicity, the maximum tolerated dose may be further evaluated or determined to be exceeded based on discussions with the investigators and medical monitors.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, every 8 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1, and at the Final visit up to approximately 2 years.</time_frame>

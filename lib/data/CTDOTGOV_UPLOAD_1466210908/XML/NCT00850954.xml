      Objectives:

      Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) is a major public health problem in the United States.
      Studies conducted in this country and internationally have irrefutably shown the causal role
      of passively inhaled cigarette smoke in development and exacerbation of acute and chronic
      diseases.

      The intervention will be delivered primarily in the form of fotonovelas based on smoking
      cessation programs previously developed, and the national telephone quit line specifically
      designed to serve Latino users. The intervention addresses the needs of Mexican American
      families (youth, middle-aged, and older adults). The evaluation study will be a randomized,
      controlled trial with assessments at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. Up to
      125 households will be recruited from the established cohort of Mexican American households
      located in the Houston metropolitan area.

      The objectives for this study are as follows:

      1. Reduction in secondhand smoke exposure: The study will distinguish if a tailored
      intervention designed to address the needs of the target group will reduce objectively and
      subjectively measured secondhand smoke exposure of nonsmokers in MA households.

      1a. Develop tailored Fotonovelas for intervention implementation

      2. Smoking cessation: The study will identify if a tailored intervention designed to address
      the needs of the target group will help the primary smokers in the household quit smoking.

      3. Stages of change: The study will identify if the proposed intervention will have a
      significant impact on the primary smoker(s) progression through the stages of smoking
      cessation.

      4. Knowledge and attitudes: The study will identify if the proposed intervention will result
      in better knowledge and changed attitudes towards secondhand smoke exposure among members of
      MA households (smokers and nonsmokers) compared to standard care.

      5. Perceived health: The study will distinguish whether reduced exposure to secondhand smoke
      would improve perceived health.

      If you choose to take part in this behavioral study, each household will be randomly
      assigned to one of 2 study groups. Each study group will receive a different set of learning
      tools. You will have an equal chance of being assigned to each group.

      During Visit 1, researchers will come to your home and explain the study. You will receive a
      detailed description of the project's goals and procedures. The study staff member will ask
      you a series of questions to find out about the people who live in your home. The interview
      will take about 40-50 minutes. Project staff will set up 2 air quality monitors in your
      home. Each monitor is about the size of a deck of cards. The monitors will be used to
      measure the air quality in the home.

      During Visit 2 (about 1 week after Visit 1), the air quality monitors will be collected.
      Both participating adult members of the household will be surveyed (on a laptop computer)
      about their lifestyle habits. This will take about 30-40 minutes. In addition, learning
      tools will be provided.

      About 6 months later, you will have 2 more follow-up visits. During Visit 3, project staff
      will again set up 2 new air quality monitors in your home. Seven (7) days later (Visit 4),
      project staff will return to the home to collect the monitors. The same participating adult
      members of the household will be surveyed again (on a laptop computer) about their lifestyle
      habits. This will take about 30-40 minutes.

      In another 6 months (12 months from the start of the study), you will have the last 2
      follow-up visits. During Visit 5, project staff will again set up 2 air quality monitors in
      your home. Seven (7) days later (Visit 6), project staff will return to your home to collect
      the monitors. The same participating adult members of the household will be surveyed again
      (on a laptop computer) about their lifestyle habits. This will take about 30-40 minutes. At
      the end of this visit, you will have completed the study. Up to 125 households will take
      part in this study.

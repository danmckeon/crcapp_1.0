    <textblock>
      This a Phase I, Open-Label, Multicentre Study to assess the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumour activity of gefitinib in combination with
      MEDI4736 (anti PD-L1) in Subjects with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study
      consists of two phases: Escalation phase and an expansion phase to be conducted in locally
      advanced or metastatic NSCLC subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Escalation phase: MEDI4736 and gefitinib in NSCLC subjects In Expansion phase: Subjects
      with EGFR mutation positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC will be enrolled in
      expansion arms. Initiation of expansion arms with the recommended dose of MEDI4736 in
      combination with gefitinib will be based on an adequate safety and tolerability profile of
      the combination from the escalation phase.

    <description>AEs: Type, incidence, severity, seriousness and relationship to study medications of adverse events (AE) (graded by the National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]; Safety Labs: Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, thyroid function tests and urinalysis will be taken at the visits; any laboratory abnormalities, and including dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), ECG measurements and Creatinine Clearance</description>

    <time_frame>From baseline assessment to disease progression, assessed up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>At each visit subjects will be programmatically assigned a RECIST visit response of CR, PR, SD or PD depending on the status of their disease compared to baseline and previous assessments; Objective response rate: the percentage of subjects who have at least one visit response of CR or PR prior to any evidence of progression . Disease control rate: the percentage of subjects who have at least one visit response of CR or PR or SD prior to any evidence of progression. Progression Free Survival (PFS) : the time from start of study treatment to the first documentation of objective disease progression (PD) or death from any cause.</description>

    <measure>To determine the immunogenicity of MEDI4736 in combination with gefitinib: anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)</measure>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Assessed by evaluating the number and percentage of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). The impact of ADAs on overall MEDI4736 PK will also be evaluated.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>PD-L1 levels before and after treatment with MEDI4736 will be measured to evaluate its association with response to treatment with MEDI4736 and clinical outcome</description>

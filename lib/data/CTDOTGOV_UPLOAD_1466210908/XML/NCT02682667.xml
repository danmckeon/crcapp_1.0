  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Cancer has a major impact in the United States and across the world. In 2015, over 1.5
      million new cases of cancer were diagnosed in the U.S. Researchers want to study samples
      from people with cancer or a pre-malignant condition. They hope to develop more effective
      treatments.

      Objective:

      To better understand the biology of malignancies and why certain cancers respond differently
      to treatment.

      Eligibility:

      Adults at least 18 years old with cancer or a pre-cancerous condition.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. Their
      diagnosis will be confirmed by the NCI Laboratory of Pathology.

      Participants will send tissue blocks or slides from their original tumor biopsy.

      At least once, participants will have a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine
      tests.

      Participants may have the following tests. They may have them more than once:

      Apheresis. A needle in one arm removes blood. Blood is run through a machine and the sample
      cells are taken out. The rest of the blood is returned by a needle in the other arm.

      Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. The hipbone will be numbed. A needle will be put into the
      hipbone. Bone marrow will be taken out through the needle.

      Piece of cancer tissue taken by a needle and syringe.

      Computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or positron emission
      tomography (PET) scan or ultrasound to help locate their tumor. For the scans, they lie in a
      machine that takes pictures.

      A small piece of skin removed.

      Participants will be contacted by phone once a year to find out how they are doing.

      Background:

      -Immunotherapy is a promising approach to the treatment of cancer. ETIB investigators are
      studying immunotherapy for the treatment of diverse malignant and premalignant conditions.
      These studies require the collection of biospecimens for research purposes.

      Objectives:

        -  To collect and bank blood, apheresis products, tumor, body fluids, and other
           biospecimens from patients with cancer or a premalignant disease.

        -  To collect and bank biospecimens as directed by companion ETIB immunotherapy clinical
           trial protocols.

        -  To conduct nucleic acid, protein, and immunological and biological research studies on
           samples collected.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients must be 18 years of age or older with a diagnosis of cancer or a premalignant
      condition.

      Design:

        -  Up to 500 subjects will be enrolled.

        -  Patients will undergo sampling of blood, apheresis products, tumor, effusions, ascites,
           urine, bone marrow, serum, plasma, skin, mucosa, or other tissues for banking and
           laboratory studies.

        -  No investigational or experimental therapy will be given as part of this protocol.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended
      phase II dose (RP2D) of INC280 in combination with erlotinib in the Phase Ib of this study,
      and to assess the anti-tumor activity and safety of INC280 alone, and in combination with
      erlotinib, versus platinum with pemetrexed in the Phase II of this study, in adult patients
      with EGFR mutated, cMET amplified, advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with
      acquired resistance to prior EGFR TKI.

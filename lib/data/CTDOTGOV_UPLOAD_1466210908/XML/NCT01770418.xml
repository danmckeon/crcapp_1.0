      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effects (good and bad) on subjects and
      their cancer using standard chemotherapy in combination with hypofractionated proton
      radiation therapy. Hypofractionation is a technique that delivers higher daily doses of
      radiation over a shorter period of time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional fractionated photon-based radiotherapy to 60-63 Gy at 1.8-2 Gy/fraction with
      concurrent chemotherapy remains the standard treatment practice in patients with stage III
      non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with local control rates of approximately 50% and a
      median overall survival of just 18 months.Unfortunately, even the standard treatment has
      significant toxicity with approximately 40% of patients developing grade 3 or higher acute
      toxicities in the RTOG 9410 study.1 These outcomes are poor and more effective treatment
      regimens are needed.

      Higher doses of radiation have been hypothesized to improve local control in patients with
      stage III NSCLC. This is expected to translate into better overall survival.Given the
      significant improvements in outcome in patients receiving hypofractionation for stage I
      NSCLC, perhaps similar gains could be achieved if hypofractionated radiotherapy could be
      safely delivered to stage II-III NSCLC with concurrent chemotherapy. Hypofractionated
      radiotherapy may offer improvement in local control compared with conventional fractionation
      that may translate into improved overall survival. Furthermore, hypofractionation will
      shorten the time interval during which patients are receiving less aggressive chemotherapy.
      Proton therapy is a highly conformal radiotherapy technique that takes advantage of the
      proton's characteristic Bragg Peak, resulting in significant reductions in the exit dose of
      the treatment beam. Thus, proton therapy can substantially reduce the dose to critical
      structures even compared with IMRT.

      This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of delivering hypofractionated proton
      therapy with concurrent chemotherapy in patients with stage II-III NSCLC

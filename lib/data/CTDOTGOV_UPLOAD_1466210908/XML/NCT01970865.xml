        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Evidence of histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic NSCLC
             (Stage IV, AJCC v7.0) that carries an ALK rearrangement, as determined by the Food
             and Drug Administration (FDA) approved FISH assay (Abbott Molecular Inc) or by
             Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Ventana Inc), or a ROS1 rearrangement as determined by
             FISH or RT PCR or Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) via a local diagnostic test (LDT).
             All patients (ALK positive and ROS1 positive) must have archival tissue sample
             available and collected prior to enrollment.

          -  Disease Status Requirements:

        Phase 1: ALK-positive NSCLC and ROS1-positive patients must either be treatment naïve in
        the advanced setting or have had disease progression after at least 1 previous ALK/ROS1
        inhibitor therapy(ies).

        Phase 2:

        ALK-positive NSCLC patients must either be or have had:

          -  Treatment naïve (ie, no prior chemotherapy in the metastatic disease setting and no
             prior ALK inhibitor therapy allowed).

          -  Disease progression after crizotinib only. No prior chemotherapy is allowed in the
             metastatic disease setting.

          -  Disease progression after crizotinib and 1 or 2 prior regimens of chemotherapy in the
             metastatic disease setting.

          -  Disease progression after 1 prior ALK inhibitor therapy other than crizotinib.
             Patients may have had any number of prior chemotherapy regimens in any disease
             setting.

          -  Disease progression after 2 prior ALK inhibitor therapies. Patients may have had any
             number of prior chemotherapy regimens in any disease setting.

          -  Disease progression after 3 prior ALK inhibitor therapies. Patients may have had any
             number of prior chemotherapy regimens in any disease setting.

        ROS1-positive NSCLC patients may be:

          -  Treatment naïve (ie, no prior chemotherapy in the metastatic disease setting and no
             prior ROS inhibitor therapy).

          -  Any number of prior therapies (ie, chemotherapy and/or ROS inhibitor therapies).

               -  Tumor Requirements:

        All Patients must have at least one measurable target extracranial lesion according to
        RECIST v1.1. In addition patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases (including patients
        asymptomatic by means of stable or decreasing doses of steroids within the last 2 weeks
        prior to study entry) will be eligible. Patients who have leptomeningeal disease (LM) or
        carcinomatous meningitis (CM) are eligible.

          -  Adequate Bone Marrow, Pancreatic Function, Renal Function and Liver Function.

          -  Negative Serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential Exclusion

             entry.

          -  Prior therapy with an antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation
             or immune checkpoint pathways, including, but not limited to, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1,
             anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4
             (anti-CTLA-4) antibody.

          -  Active and clinically significant bacterial, fungal, or viral infection including
             hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or

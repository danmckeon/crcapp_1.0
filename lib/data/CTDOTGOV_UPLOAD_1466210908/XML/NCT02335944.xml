      The study determines the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      EGF816 in combination with INC280 and to estimate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of
      EGF816 in combination with INC280 in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) with documented EGFR mutation.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically documented, locally advanced or recurrent (stage IIIB

             non-small cell lung cancer

          -  Patients must have locally documented EGFR mutation L858R and/or ex19del, or a
             characterized de novo EGFR T790M mutation

          -  Presence of at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST v.1.1

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2

          -  Patients must be screened for HBV. Patients who are either HBsAg positive or HBV-DNA
             positive must be willing and able to take antiviral therapy 1-2 weeks prior to 1st
             dose of EGF816 treatment and continue on antiviral therapy for at least 4 weeks after
             the last dose of EGF816. Additional management of the patients would be provided by a
             physician with expertise in management of HBV, if needed.

          -  Patients must be screened for HCV. Patients must have negative hepatitis C antibody
             (HCV Ab) or are HCV Ab positive but with an undetectable level of HCV-RNA. Note:
             patients with detectable HCV-RNA are not eligible for the study.

          -  Phase Ib only: documented progression of disease according to RECIST v1.1 while on
             continuous treatment with EGFR TKI (erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib).

             duration), PR (any duration), or SD for at least 6 months) on prior EGFR TKI (e.g.
             erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib, and subsequently demonstrated progression according
             to RECIST v1.1.

          -  Phase II Group 2 only: Advanced NSCLC patients who have not been previously treated

          -  Phase Ib and Phase II Group 1 only: patients who have received more than three prior
             lines of antineoplastic therapies (including EGFR TKI) in advanced setting.

          -  Phase II Group 2 only: patients who have received more than two previous lines of
             antineoplastic therapies in the advanced setting.

          -  Phase II Group 2 only: previous treatment with an investigational or marketed agent

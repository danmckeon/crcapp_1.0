  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation/dose-expansion study of INCB057643 in subjects with
      advanced malignancies. Part 1 will determine the maximum tolerated dose of INCB057643 and/or
      a tolerated dose that demonstrates sufficient pharmacologic activity. Part 2 will further
      evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, PK, and PD of the dose(s) selected in Part 1 in
      select tumor types.

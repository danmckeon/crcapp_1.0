  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to perform a pilot study on patients undergoing
      laryngoscopy for diagnostic and tumor staging purposes (for pharyngeal or laryngeal cancer)
      in which intraoperative CT imaging will be performed both prior to (but after induction of
      general endotracheal anesthesia) and during placement of the laryngoscope in order to better
      understand anatomic changes that occur during instrumentation of the oral cavity and
      oropharynx. The goals of the study are:

        1. Develop a suite of de-identified images and surface renderings that qualitatively show
           how a tumor and the upper aerodigestive tract anatomy deform during a laryngoscopic
           evaluation.

        2. Create deformation models of the upper aerodigestive tract.

      This data to be used for future retractor development as well as for virtual image guided
      surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (&gt;18 years) seen in the Head and Neck Tumor Clinic who will require
             laryngoscopy in the operating room for diagnosis and staging of known or suspected
             tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are unable to tolerate general anesthesia.

          -  Patients who are felt to be a &quot;difficult airway&quot; for induction of general
             endotracheal anesthesia.

          -  Patients with excessive dental restorations and amalgam.

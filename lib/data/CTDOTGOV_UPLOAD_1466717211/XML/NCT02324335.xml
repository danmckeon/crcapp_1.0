  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral Mucositis (OM) is a painful and debilitating side effect of many of the drug or
      radiation regimens used to treat cancer. This study examines the investigational drug
      brilacidin and its possible application in prevention of oral mucositis in patients
      undergoing chemoradiation for treatment of head and neck cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether daily oral rinses with a solution containing brilacidin will
      prevent the occurrences of OM or lessen the severity of OM if it occurs. Patients will use
      an oral rinse 3 times daily for up to seven weeks during chemoradiation for head and neck
      cancer.

          1. Willing and able to read, understand and sign an informed consent form (ICF)

          2. Have recently-diagnosed (within previous 3 months), pathologically-confirmed,
             non-metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and/or oropharynx, that
             will be treated with CRT therapy as first line treatment; scans (CAT, PET, and/or
             MRI) obtained within 45 days prior to consenting (screening) can be used to determine
             the patient's eligibility

          3. Have a plan to receive a continuous course of conventional external beam irradiation
             delivered by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) as single daily fractions of 2.0
             Gy to 2.2 Gy with a cumulative radiation dose ≥55 Gy and ≤72 Gy. Planned radiation
             treatment fields must include at least two oral sites (buccal mucosa, floor of mouth,
             ventral/lateral tongue, soft palate) with each site receiving ≥ 55 Gy [Note: the
             independent RTQA consultant must confirm that the planned radiation treatment meets
             the protocol criteria]

          4. Have a plan to receive a standard cisplatin chemotherapy regimen administered weekly
             (30-40 mg/m2) or approximately every 21 days (80-100 mg/m2)

          5. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          6. Have adequate hematopoietic, hepatic, and renal function at a screening visit
             (clinical laboratory tests must be obtained 4 to 10 days prior to anticipated
             initiation of RT and study drug treatment)

          7. Urine pregnancy test: negative for female patients of childbearing potential

          8. Agree to utilize medically accepted methods of birth control during study
             participation and for 30 days following the last treatment with study drug if a
             female subject is of childbearing potential or if a male subject has an opposite sex
             partner of child bearing potential.

          1. Has tumor(s) of the lips, sinuses, salivary glands, nasopharynx, larynx, hypopharynx
             or unknown primary tumor

          2. Has metastatic disease (M1) Stage IV C

          5. Plan to be treated with induction chemotherapy before initiation of RT

          6. Has a history of other malignant tumors within the last 5 years, except non melanoma
             skin cancer or in situ cervical carcinoma curatively excised

          7. Has had a major surgical procedure, other than for HNC, or significant traumatic
             injury within 4 weeks prior to the initiation of RT; anticipation of need for major
             surgical procedure during the course of the study

          8. Has incompletely healed sites of dental extractions

          9. Has an 12-lead ECG obtained at screening visit which shows medically significant
             abnormality(ies) (e.g. left bundle branch block, frequent premature ventricular
             contractions, QTc interval prolongation &gt; 450 msec for males and &gt; 470 msec for
             females)

         10. Has untreated hypertension (SBP ≥145 mmHg and/or DBP ≥90 mmHg)

         11. Has active infectious disease undergoing systemic treatment excluding oral

         14. Has known seropositivity for HIV or hepatitis C antibody, or antigen positive and
             antibody negative for hepatitis B (testing for these infections is not required for

         15. Use of any investigational agent within 30 days of randomization

         16. Is pregnant or breastfeeding

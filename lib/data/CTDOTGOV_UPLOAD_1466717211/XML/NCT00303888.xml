      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Phenoxodiol may help docetaxel work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of docetaxel when
      given together with either phenoxodiol or placebo and to see how well it works in treating
      patients with recurrent advanced ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or
      primary peritoneal cavity cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of combination therapy comprising phenoxodiol and
           docetaxel in patients with recurrent or persistent advanced ovarian epithelial,
           fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effect of phenoxodiol on the toxicity of docetaxel using a weekly
           treatment regimen.

        -  Determine if combination therapy comprising phenoxodiol and docetaxel is more
           efficacious than docetaxel therapy alone.

        -  Determine if combination therapy comprising phenoxodiol and docetaxel affects blood
           levels of either drug.

        -  Determine phenotypic differences in the tumor cells of &quot;responders&quot; and
           &quot;non-responders.&quot;

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral placebo
           three times daily on days 1-21.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral phenoxodiol three times daily on days 1-21 and docetaxel
           as in arm I.

      Treatment in both arms repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 3
      months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving ruxolitinib phosphate (oral JAK inhibitor
      INCB18424) works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell or
      peripheral T-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma and are ineligible to stem cell transplant or have
      recurrent disease after stem cell transplant. Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the overall response rate (ORR) of subjects with relapsed diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma (DLBCL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) who are relapsed or refractory to
      front-line treatment and ineligible for stem cell transplantation or have recurrent disease
      after stem cell transplantation to oral ruxolitinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate safety of oral ruxolitinib in subjects with DLBCL and PTCL. II. Determine
      progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response, and overall response (OS) in subjects
      with DLBCL and PTCL.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore the relationship between responses to oral ruxolitinib and alterations in gene
      expression profiling (GEP) signatures as well as biomarker immunophenotypic changes related
      to JAK2/STAT3, NF-ÎºB, BCR, PI3K/AKT, and mTOR pathways.

      II. Evaluate potential effect of oral ruxolitinib exposure on JAK2/STAT3 pathway inhibition
      in serial tumor samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate (oral JAK inhibitor INCB18424) orally (PO) twice
      daily (BID). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months thereafter.

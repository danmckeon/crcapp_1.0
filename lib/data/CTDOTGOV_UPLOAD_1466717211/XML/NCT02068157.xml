    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of interstitial photodynamic therapy in patients
      with head and neck cancer that has come back. Interstitial photodynamic therapy uses a
      combination of laser light and a light-sensitive drug called porfimer sodium to destroy
      tumors. During treatment a laser light is used to activate the drug. Interstitial
      photodynamic therapy may be an effective treatment for head and neck cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Demonstrate that our image-guided interstitial photodynamic therapy (I-PDT) dosimetry
      system can be used to tailor this therapy to individual patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive porfimer sodium intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes on day 0. Patients then
      undergo image-guided I-PDT on day 2.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, and then
      every 2 months for up to 12 months.

    <description>A logistic model will be fit to the relationship between the probability of changes in tumor response with intra-tumoral light dose. Wald tests of the model effects will be performed to assess statistical significance at the 0.1 level of significance. A number of diagnostic plots and statistics will be calculated in the evaluation of the model fit.</description>

             pharynx, (oropharynx, larynx) and neck

          -  Tumor accessible for unrestricted illumination for interstitial photodynamic therapy
             (PDT) (accessibility as determined by the physician)

          -  Patients on chemotherapy &amp;/or targeted agents for palliation

          -  Life expectancy of at least 6 months in the judgment of the physician

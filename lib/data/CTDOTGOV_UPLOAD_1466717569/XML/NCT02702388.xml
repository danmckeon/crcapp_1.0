      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study being conducted as a postmarketing
      requirement to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate whether there is a
      lower starting dosage of lenvatinib other than the approved 24 mg once daily (QD) that
      provides comparable efficacy but has a better safety profile in participants with RR-DTC
      with radiographic evidence of disease progression within the prior 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of 2 phases, the Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase. The
      Prerandomization Phase will last no longer than 28 days and will include a Screening Period
      to establish protocol eligibility and a Baseline Period to confirm eligibility and establish
      disease characteristics prior to randomization and treatment.

      The Randomization Phase will consist of a Treatment Period and a Follow-up Period. It will
      begin at the time of randomization of the first participant and will consist of 28-day
      blinded study treatment cycles. The End of Study will occur at the end of the Randomization
      Phase, which is defined as when the last participant enrolled completes the Week 24 tumor
      assessments or discontinues study treatment if before Week 24. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to treatment with 1 of 3 blinded dosages of lenvatinib in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive
      lenvatinib 24 mg, 20 mg, or 14 mg orally QD. Dose reductions will occur in succession based
      on the previous dose level (24, 20, 14, 10, 8, or 4 mg QD). Once the dose has been reduced,
      it may not be increased at a later date.

          6. Participants must be receiving thyroxine suppression therapy and thyroid stimulating
             hormone (TSH) should not be elevated (TSH should be ‚â§5.50 mcIU/ML). When tolerated by
             the participant, thyroxine dose should be changed to achieve TSH suppression (TSH
             &lt;0.50 mcIU/ML) and this dose may be changed concurrently upon starting study drug
             treatment.

                  metastases, the liver-specific alkaline phosphatase must be separated from the
                  total and used to assess the liver function instead of total alkaline
                  phosphatase.

             of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of B-hCG. A separate baseline assessment is required
             if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the
             first dose of study drug.

         16. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are
             postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate

             oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing).

         17. Females of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant and use highly
             effective contraception while on treatment with lenvatinib and for at least 1 month
             after finishing treatment. Females of childbearing potential must not have had
             unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days before study entry and must agree to
             use a highly effective method of contraception (eg, total abstinence, an intrauterine
             device, a contraceptive implant, an oral contraceptive, or have a vasectomized
             partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout the entire study period and for 30
             days after study drug discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives
             must have been on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at
             least 4 weeks before dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during
             the study and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. Women using oral hormonal
             contraceptives should add a barrier method.

         18. Participants must voluntarily agree to provide written informed consent.

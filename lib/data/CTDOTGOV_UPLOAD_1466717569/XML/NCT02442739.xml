  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give patients with head and
      neck cancer a low dose of the FDA approved anesthetic drug ketamine at the same time they
      receive radiation, chemotherapy, and/or surgery for their cancer treatment to prevent
      depression and its effects. Researchers would also like to see if giving ketamine at the
      same time as cancer treatment is practical and reasonably acceptable to the patient.

      The American Psychiatric Association has reported that up to about half of patients with
      head and neck cancer develop depression which has many negative impacts on cancer care and
      its outcomes. Therefore, investigators would also like to see if giving patients ketamine
      during their routine cancer treatment will prevent the onset of depression and its negative
      effects on cancer treatment outcomes, and also help with anxiety, pain, and quality of life.
      The study will also use a placebo to compare to the good and/or bad effects of ketamine. A
      placebo is not an active drug and it will be look the same as ketamine, as a liquid to be
      taken by mouth.

      Ketamine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a general anesthetic
      by itself for some diagnostic and surgical procedures or combined with other general
      anesthetic agents. It has also been shown to reduce cancer pain. Ketamine is considered
      experimental in this study because it is not approved by the FDA for the prevention of
      depression.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, double blind, randomized, two-arm feasibility study of
      oral ketamine versus placebo for the prevention of depression in non-depressed patients with
      head and neck cancer undergoing curative intent cancer therapy. Approximately 20 patients
      with head and neck cancer about to undergo cancer therapy will be randomized 1:1 to receive
      study treatment with one of the following regimens:

        -  Arm A: weekly oral administration of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine

        -  Arm B: weekly oral administration of placebo

      Consenting patients will undergo screening procedures, and if eligible, a baseline interview
      and brief questionnaires regarding depression, mental and emotional health, and quality of
      life assessments.

      Study treatment will be administered for 16 weeks unless the patient experiences
      unacceptable toxicities, exhibits moderate to severe depressive symptoms, or withdraws
      consent. Patients on the placebo treatment arm will not be eligible to cross over to the
      ketamine arm at evidence of depression but will be removed from the study and treated with
      standard medical management for depression.

      Patients will be asked to complete psychosocial measurements every two weeks, before study
      medication/placebo administration, while on study treatment and monthly during a six-month
      follow-up period.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the ability of grape exosomes, given to the subject as grape
      powder, as an important anti-inflammatory agent to reduce the incidence of oral mucositis
      during radiation and chemotherapy treatment for head and neck tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the ability of plant (grape) exosomes to prevent
      oral mucositis associated with chemoradiation treatment of head and neck cancer. Also, to be
      evaluated is the effect of grape exosomes on the production of cytokines and immune
      responses to tumor exosomal antigens, metabolic and molecular markers in these patients.

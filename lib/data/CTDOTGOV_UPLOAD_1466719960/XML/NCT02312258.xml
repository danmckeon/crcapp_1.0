    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of ixazomib maintenance therapy on
      progression free survival (PFS) compared with placebo, in participants with newly diagnosed
      multiple myeloma (NDMM) who have had a major response (complete response [CR], very good
      partial response [VGPR], or partial response [PR]) to initial therapy and who have not
      undergone stem-cell transplantation (SCT).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called ixazomib citrate. Ixazomib citrate is being
      tested to slow disease progression and improve overall survival in people who have newly
      diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who have had a major positive response to initial therapy
      and have not undergone stem cell transplantation (SCT). This study will look at the effect
      of ixazomib citrate has on the length of time that participants are free of disease
      progression and their overall survival.

      The study will enroll approximately 761 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Ixazomib citrate 3 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but
           has no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle,
      for up to 26 cycles.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 24 months. Participants will make 28 visits to the clinic during the
      treatment period and will continue to make follow-up visits every 4 weeks until the next
      line of therapy begins. Participants will also be contacted by telephone every 12 weeks
      after last treatment visit for a follow-up assessment.

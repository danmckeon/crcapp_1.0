    <description>Folotyn will be administered by IV push at a dose of 30 mg/m2 once weekly for 6 weeks in each cycle, followed by 1 week of rest (no treatment).
Leucovorin (25 mg tablets) will be taken orally tid for 2 days for a total of six doses (150 mg cumulative weekly dose), beginning 24 hours after each dose of Folotyn is administered.
Folic acid and Vitamin B12 is given prior to initiation of Folotyn.</description>

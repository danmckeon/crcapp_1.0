    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to identify a dose and schedule of CC-486 that can be safely
      administered with R-CHOP. To evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the
      maximal administered dose (MAD) of CC-486 in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) in subjects with high risk (IPI 3 or more)
      previously untreated DLBCL or Grade 3B FL, or transformed lymphoma. Also, to determine
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of CC-486 when administered alone and in combination with R-CHOP and
      to explore preliminary efficacy of CC-486 plus R-CHOP by 2007 International Working Group
      (IWG) criteria. Finally, to evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of CC-486, to evaluate
      potential predictive/correlative biomarkers for DLBCL subgroups that are considered
      important and to explore cytidine deaminase (CDA) activity and polymorphisms.

      The purpose of this study is to look at the safety of oral azacitidine when combined with
      R-CHOP (drugs normally used in treating Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or Grade 3B follicular
      lymphoma). The other purposes of this study are to understand how the human body takes in
      and removes oral azacitidine when given with R-CHOP, if the Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or
      Grade 3B follicular lymphoma tumor size decreases, and to look into the effects the drug can
      have on the human body.

      Oral azacitidine in combination with R-CHOP has not been approved for the treatment of
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or Grade 3B follicular lymphoma and its use in this study is
      investigational.

      This study is separated into three periods: Screening and Registration, Treatment and
      Follow-up periods. Before you can receive the study drug the doctor will perform tests to
      find out whether you can participate in the study (This is done during the Screening
      Period). If you and your doctor determine that you can participate, you will be registered
      and enter a short registration period of a maximum of 10 days. During the Registration
      Period the doctor will assign you one dose of oral azacitidine.

      The Treatment period starts when you receive the study drug. The maximum time you will
      receive study treatment is 5 months. The intent is for you to complete 6 cycles of
      treatment. Each cycle will be 21 days. The Follow-up period starts when your treatment is
      completed, changed or discontinued for any reason. You will have fewer exams, tests and
      visits. These visits will be every 6 months for up to 2 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed previously untreated DLBCL or Grade 3B FL, [double-positive
             for BCL2 and c-MYC] or transformed lymphoma. Transformed lymphoma from FL or marginal
             zone lymphoma, but not chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [Richter Transformation]
             are allowed as long as no prior anti-lymphoma therapy of any kind has been
             administered.

               1. A formalin fixed paraffin embedded lymph node or tumor biopsy specimen must be
                  submitted during the Screening Period. The specimen must have been acquired by a
                  surgical or core needle biopsy (≥ 2 cores at baseline); material from a fine
                  needle aspiration is not acceptable.

               2. Fresh core biopsy, frozen, must be performed before start of therapy and
                  submitted for storage. This is optional only for the subjects who have a
                  biopsy-accessible site and consent to the procedure. In case no prior fixed
                  formalin paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsy is available, this specimen can also be
                  used for diagnostic confirmation.

               3. No prior anti-lymphoma therapy. However, for subjects with bulky
                  disease,systemic symptoms, compressive disease, or rapidly progressing
                  adenopathies, pre-phase treatment with 1 mg/kg/day prednisone, or equivalent,
                  for a maximum of 7 days is permitted prior to Cycle 1 Day -6 at the discretion
                  of the Investigator. In exceptional cases, if clinically indicated, a higher
                  dose of steroids and/or a slightly longer duration is allowed for the purpose of
                  urgent symptom management, and the subjects is considered eligible. A washout
                  period does not apply. However the fresh core biopsy mentioned above should be
                  performed before starting prednisone.

          2. International Prognostic Index score ≥ 2 or DLBCL with double-positive for BCL2 and
             c-MYC by IHC (immunohistochemistry) or FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) based
             on local pathology lab assessment.

          3. Measurable disease on cross section imaging by CT (computed tomography) that is at
             least 1.5 cm in the longest diameter and measurable in two perpendicular dimensions
             as defined by IWG (International Working Group) response criteria for NHL
             (non-Hodgkin Lymphoma).

          4. Ann Arbor stage II to IV.

          5. Men and women 18 years of age to 80 years of age of any ethnic origin or race at the

          6. Understand and voluntarily sign an ICD (Informed Consent Document) prior to any study
             related assessments/procedures are conducted.

          7. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

          8. Performance status ≤ 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale.

          9. Negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours before starting study treatment on
             Cycle 1 Day -6 for females of childbearing potential (FCBP). A female of
             child-bearing potential, defined as a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone
             a hysterectomy (the surgical removal of the uterus) or bilateral oophorectomy (the
             surgical removal of both ovaries) or, 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at
             least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time during the preceding 24

             conditions:

               1. Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to the use of a physician-approved
                  contraceptive method (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive;
                  tubal ligation; intrauterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or
                  vasectomized partner) without interruption, while on CC-486 (including dose
                  interruptions); and for 3 months following the last dose of IP; and

               2. Agree to have a medically supervised serum pregnancy test with sensitivity of at
                  least 25 mIU/mL obtained at Screening. A serum pregnancy test is to be performed
                  within 72 hours prior to Day 1 of starting study therapy on Cycle 1 Day -6, and
                  within 72 hours prior to Day 1 of every subsequent cycle, and at the Treatment
                  Discontinuation Visit. The subject may not receive IP until the Investigator has
                  verified that the result of the pregnancy test is negative.

         10. Male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential must either commit to
             true abstinence* or agree to the use of a physician-approved contraceptive method
             throughout the course of the study and avoid fathering a child during the course of
             the study and for 3 months following the last dose of the IP (Investigational
             Product).

             that would prevent the subject from participating in the study.

             colitis),celiac disease (i.e., sprue), prior gastrectomy or upper bowel removal, or
             any other gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would interfere with absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the IP and/or predispose the subject to an
             increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity.

          6. Hematologic and Non-hematologic exclusion criteria before start of therapy.

          7. Seropositive for or active viral infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV):

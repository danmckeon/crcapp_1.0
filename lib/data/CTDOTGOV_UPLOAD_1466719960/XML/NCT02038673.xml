  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to determine the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of oral ASP5878 in patients with solid tumors.

      This study consists of two parts. In the dose-escalation part, ASP5878 (multiple dosing
      once-a-day (q.d.), multiple dosing twice-a-day (b.i.d.) or 5-day on/2-day off dosing
      twice-a-day (5on-2off)) is administered to patients with solid tumors in an increasing dose
      manner, and the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and
      efficacy of ASP5878 are evaluated in these patients. Cycle 0 consists of 3 days and Cycle 1
      and subsequent cycles consist of 28 days each in the dose-escalation part. In the expansion
      part, 16mg twice-a-day 5-day on/2-day off dose of ASP5878 (5on-2off) is administered to
      patients with solid tumors and safety, PK, PD and efficacy of ASP5878 are evaluated. The
      expansion part starts from Cycle 1 and each cycle consists of 28 days.

          -  Patient must meet at least one of the following criteria in the judgment of the
             investigator or sub-investigator:

               -  Disease progression despite standard therapies

               -  Progressive disease without any standard therapies established

               -  Standard therapies are considered intolerable

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1.

          -  Predicted life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks in the judgment of the investigator or
             sub-investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with ≥ Grade 2 (CTCAE v 4.0-JCOG) persistent symptoms and objective findings
             due to the toxicity attributable to prior treatment with antitumor effect (except
             alopecia).

          -  Patient who received a prior treatment intended for antitumor effect (medication,
             surgery, radiotherapy, etc.) within 4 weeks prior to the planned first day of study
             drug dosing (or patient who received mitomycin C or Nitrosourea within 6 weeks prior
             to the planned first day of study drug dosing).

          -  A major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to the planned first day of study
             drug dosing or a surgical procedure is planned during the course of the study.

          -  Patient who were treated with other investigational drug or medical device within 4
             weeks prior to the planned first day of study drug dosing.

          -  Patient who has a history of organ transplantation.

          -  Patient with a brain metastasis with symptoms or requiring treatment.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an orally available inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases TrkA (coded
      by the gene NTRK1), TrkB (coded by the gene NTRK2), TrkC (coded by the gene NTRK3), ROS1
      (coded by the gene ROS1), and ALK (coded by the gene ALK). Molecular alterations to one or
      more of these targets are present in several different tumor types, including non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), prostate cancer, papillary thyroid cancer,
      pancreatic cancer, and neuroblastoma. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer
      with a detectable molecular alteration in targets of interest may be eligible for
      enrollment.

      Phase 1 will assess safety and tolerability of entrectinib via standard dose escalation
      scheme and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic
             solid tumors that have a NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1, or ALK molecular alteration.

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST version 1.1.

          -  Prior cancer therapy is allowed, including crizotinib, ceritinib, and investigational
             drugs.

          -  Prior radiotherapy is allowed

          -  Patients with controlled asymptomatic central nervous system involvement are allowed.

          -  Resolution of all acute toxic effects (excluding alopecia) of any prior anti-cancer
             therapy to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
             (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.03 Grade less than or equal to 1.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) ≤ 2.

          -  Adult patients age 18 years or older.

          -  Prior treatment with entrectinib.

          -  Prior treatment with NTRK, ROS1, or ALK inhibitors (approved or investigational) in
             patients who have tumors that express those respective molecular alterations (e.g.,
             No prior ROS1-inhibitors in patients with ROS1 rearrangements).

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical study is to determine the safety and efficacy of VT-464, a
      lyase-selective inhibitor of CYP17, in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer
      (CRPC) who have been previously treated with enzalutamide.

      This is a Phase 2 open-label study of VT-464 in patients with progressive, metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been previously treated with
      enzalutamide. The study consists of two cohorts: patients in Cohort 1 must have never
      received prior chemotherapy and patients in Cohort 2 must have received at least one (and
      not more) prior course of chemotherapy for mCRPC.

    <description>To determine the PSA response as defined by a ≥ 50% decrease in serum PSA per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criteria after each cycle and after 12 weeks of dosing with VT-464 compared to PSA level at baseline in patients who have been previously treated with enzalutamide.</description>

    <description>Kaplan-Meier curves of progression-free survival (PFS) will be constructed in each cohort and the median PFS will be determined and informally compared to any available results.</description>

    <time_frame>32 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Overall Survival: will be analyzed similarly to PFS, with a separate Kaplan-Meier curve for each arm. A patient for whom there is no death event will be censored; the censored date will be the date of last contact.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The safety and tolerability of VT-464 by evaluating adverse events, vital signs, physical examination findings, concomitant medications and laboratory tests.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The safety of VT-464 will be evaluated by laboratory evaluation, electrocardiogram, the report of adverse events and concomitant medications at each 28-day cycle of treatment and 4-5 weeks after therapy has been discontinued.</description>

    <measure>Maximum PSA response compared to baseline</measure>

        Key Eligibility Criteria:

          -  Patients must have documented histological or cytological evidence of adenocarcinoma
             of the prostate.

          -  Must have progressive, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). There
             must be radiographic evidence of disease after primary treatment with surgery or
             radiotherapy that has continued to progress radiographically or biochemically (rising
             PSA levels on successive measurements) despite adequate androgen-deprivation therapy,
             which is defined as having undergone bilateral surgical castration or continued
             treatment on GnRH agonists or antagonists.

          -  All patients in this trial must have been treated with enzalutamide.

          -  Patients in Cohort 1 will not be allowed to have received prior chemotherapy;
             patients in Cohort 2 must have received one (and not more) prior course of
             chemotherapy for mCRPC.

          -  Progression must be evidenced and documented by any of the following parameters:

               -  PSA progression defined by a minimum of two rising PSA levels with an interval
                  of ≥ 1 week between each determination

               -  Appearance of one or more new lesions on bone scan

               -  Progressive measurable disease by RECIST 1.1

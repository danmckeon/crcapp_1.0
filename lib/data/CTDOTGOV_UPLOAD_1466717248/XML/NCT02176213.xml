  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn more about the drug, pomalidomide and to gather data on
      its safety and side effects when used in combination with commercially available
      cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone. This combination is considered experimental and has not
      been approved by the FDA.

      Pomalidomide is a third generation immunomodulatory (IMiDs) agent, which is a more potent
      version of thalidomide and lenalidomide drugs that have been approved by the United States
      Food and Drug Administration [FDA] for the treatment of MM. In February 2013, pomalidomide
      was also approved by the FDA for patients with MM who have had more than 2 types of therapy.

      Pomalidomide is taken orally as capsules, and cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone are also
      taken orally as tablets in this study. Cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone are commercially
      available and are often used in combination with other drugs to treat Multiple Myeloma.
      Preliminary data from both the laboratory and patient studies suggest that this combination
      of drugs is more effective than pomalidomide and dexamethasone alone. However, the regimen
      being used in this study, which consists of daily cyclophosphamide, also permits support of
      low blood counts with either injections or transfusions as needed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single center, phase II study of a combination of pomalidomide, daily
      low dose oral cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory
      multiple myeloma. The three oral drugs will be given in 28-day cycles: Pomalidomide 4 mg
      daily x 21 days; cyclophosphamide 50 mg BID x 21 days; and dexamethasone 40 mg weekly x 3
      (20 mg weekly if the patient aged ≥ 75 years old). Subjects meeting eligibility criteria
      with ANC &lt; 1000/µL and platelet count &lt; 50,000/µL will start at dose level -1 of both
      pomalidomide (3 mg daily) and cyclophosphamide (50 mg daily). G-CSF and platelet transfusion
      support is permitted if needed.

      Dose reduction for hematologic toxicity will begin with cyclophosphamide and then
      subsequently alternate with pomalidomide until a subject cannot tolerate dose level -2 of
      both agents - in which case subject would come off study. If subject has 2 or more
      concurrent toxicities that are potentially attributable to both agents (e.g. hematologic
      toxicity) then dose modification guidelines will be followed with dose reduction being done
      sequentially with one agent at a time, unless in the opinion of the investigator, both
      agents required concurrent dose reduction.

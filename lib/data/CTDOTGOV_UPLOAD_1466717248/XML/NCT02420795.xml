    <textblock>
      This clinical research study will be done in two parts. The goal of the first part is to
      find the highest tolerable dose of ONC201 that can be given to patients with relapsed or
      refractory MCL, DLBCL, and TLCL. Groups of subjects will receive increasing doses of ONC201
      by mouth on day 1 of each 21 days cycle until there are side effects that are not tolerated
      or a maximum of 625 mg has been found to be tolerable.

      The dose you receive may be too low to have an effect or so high it causes bad side effects.

      In the second part of this study the highest dose of NC201 will be given to learn if ONC201
      can help to control the disease.

      Please note that this is the first time ONC201 will be given to human subjects.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take your assigned dose
      of ONC201 capsules by mouth on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle. You will take the study drug in
      the clinic during Cycle 1.

      The capsules should be swallowed whole. Do not attempt to open capsules or dissolve them in
      water. Your study doctor will give you further instructions on how to take the study drug.

      If you miss a dose, you can take it up to 6 hours after the time you would have taken it. If
      it is later than 6 hours, you should skip the dose.

      If you vomit a dose and can see all of the capsules you took, you can retake the dose. If
      you vomited and cannot see all of the capsules, do not retake the dose.

      You will need to fill out diary cards with information about when you take ONC201. You
      should bring the diary cards with you to every visit.

      Study Visits

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical and neurological exam.

        -  You will have an EKG 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours after you take the study drug.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing
           before you take your study drug, 30 minutes after, 2 hours after, 4 hours after, and 6
           hours after you take it. PK testing measures the level of study drug in your blood at
           different time points.\

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for pharmacodynamic (PD) testing before you
           take your study drug. PD testing measures how the level of study drug in your body may
           affect the disease.

      On Day 2 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK and PD testing. On Day 3 of Cycle 1,
           blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK and PD testing. On Day 8 of

      Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine, PK, and PD testing.

        -  You will have an EKG.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical and neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, PK, and PD testing.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration
           to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a GI endoscopy.

        -  If you are able to become pregnant, blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine will be
           collected for a pregnancy test.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 5, and every 3 cycles after that, you will have a CT scan and a PET/CT
      scan to check the status of the disease.

      On Days 8 and 15 of Cycles 2 and beyond, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for
      routine tests.

      If the study doctor thinks the disease has completely responded to the study treatment, the
      following tests and procedures will be performed to confirm the status of the disease:

        -  You will have a colonoscopy, including a biopsy of any abnormal growths. To collect
           this biopsy, small amounts of tissue are removed with a cutting tool.

        -  You will have a bone marrow biopsy.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a PET scan. The tests may be repeated
           any time the doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the long-term follow-up
      phone calls.

      : End-of-Dosing Visit

      Within about 30 days after you finish taking the study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical and neurological exam.

        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

        -  Blood (about 4-6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check how well your
           blood clots, and for PK and PD testing.

        -  You will have a PET scan, CT scan, and chest x-ray to check the status of the disease.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or
           aspiration to check the status of the disease.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a colonoscopy and GI endoscopy to
           look for abnormal areas.

        -  If you are able to become pregnant, blood (about 1½ tablespoons) or urine will be
           collected for a pregnancy test.

      Long Term Follow-Up:

      After your end-of-dosing visit, the study staff will call you every 3 months to ask how you
      are doing and to find out about any other treatments you have received. These calls should
      take about 2-3 minutes. In addition to the phone calls, your medical records may be reviewed
      during this time as well.

      This is an investigational study. ONC201 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It
      is currently being used for research purposes only.

      Up to 60 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

             there is no active disease and is cleared by GI consultation. HIV screening is not
             required for this study.

          6. All patients with central nervous system lymphoma or known history of seizures will
             be excluded from the initial trial because ONC201 crosses the blood-brain barrier and
             this may affect their anti-seizure therapy.

             the MCL, within the subsequent 6 months at the time of consent. Investigator
             discretion is allowed.

         12. Patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III and IV heart failure,
             myocardial infarction in the preceding 6 months, and significant conduction
             abnormalities, including but not limited to 2nd degree AV block type II, 3rd degree
             block, QT prolongation (QTc &gt; 500 msec), sick sinus syndrome, ventricular
             tachycardia, symptomatic bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 50 bpm), hypotension, light
             headedness and syncope. Patients with active atrial fibrillation will be excluded.
             The protocol excludes patients who have within the past year had a stent and by
             recommendation of their cardiologist need to stay on anticoagulants such as warfarin
             equivalent vitamin K antagonist.

         13. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to ONC201 or its excipients.

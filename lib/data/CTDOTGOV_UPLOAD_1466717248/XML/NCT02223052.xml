    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, randomized, 2-period crossover study consisting
      of 2 phases: Pharmacokinetics and Extension.

      The study will enroll approximately 60 subjects with hematologic or solid tumor
      malignancies, excluding gastrointestinal tumors and tumors that have originated or
      metastasized to the liver. Approximately 8 sites in the US will participate in this study.

      Currently, the 150 mg tablet formulation (F8) of CC-486 is being provided to subjects in two
      large Phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled studies in lower-risk MDS and AML maintenance.
      This CC-486-CAGEN-001 study is designed to assess the bioequivalence of CC-486 when
      administered once daily as one 300 mg tablet (F9) relative to two 150 mg tablets (F8) in
      adult cancer subjects with hematologic malignancies or various tumor types excluding
      gastrointestinal tumors and tumors that have originated or metastasized to the liver.

      Following confirmation of eligibility during screening, subjects will be randomized to one
      of two dosing sequences in the pharmacokinetics (PK) phase and will have blood samples taken
      prior to dosing and at several time points during the 8 hours following dosing. Safety
      information will be collected in this phase and the PK parameters describing the levels of
      investigational product (IP) in circulation will be used to assess bioequivalence of the two
      formulations.

      In the extension phase of the study, Vidaza® (Azacitidine for Injection) will be provided
      for ≤ 6 cycles as an opportunity for subjects who currently have limited treatment options
      or have failed previous therapies. It is up to the discretion of the investigator to treat
      the subject with Vidaza® for the diagnosed malignancy at study entry in this phase. Only
      safety information will be collected in this phase.

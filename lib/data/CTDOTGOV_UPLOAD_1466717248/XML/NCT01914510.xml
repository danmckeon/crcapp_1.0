  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study to see how useful, safe, and tolerable an investigational drug
      called ENMD-2076 is in treating patients with ovarian clear cell carcinomas.

      ENMD-2076 is an oral drug that works by blocking certain enzymes called Aurora A and
      tyrosine kinase from working. These enzymes are needed for cells to divide including cancer
      cells. ENMD-2076 also works by stopping the growth of new blood vessels which would provide
      the tumor with nutrients for it to grow. It is believed that by blocking Aurora A and
      tyrosine kinase enzymes from working and stopping new blood vessels from growing, the tumors
      may stop growing or shrink.

    <textblock>
      During the study, participants will be asked to take ENMD-2076 once a day, everyday. Every
      28 days will be called a cycle. While receiving the study drug, participants will be asked
      to visit the clinic for tests and procedures. During Cycle 1, participants will be asked to
      visit the clinic about once a week and during Cycle 2 and future cycles, participants will
      be asked to visit the clinic on days 1 and 15. As a part of the study, tumor tissue
      (archival and fresh tumor biopsy) will be taken for biomarker research. When participants
      stop the study drug, they will be asked to have an end of study drug visit.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have histologically documented diagnosis of ovarian clear cell carcinoma.

          -  Any number of prior chemotherapy regimens will be allowed but must include 1 line of
             platinum based therapy, and may include chemotherapy, biologics or other targeted
             therapies (except for Aurora A targeted therapies).

          -  Meet RECIST criteria (version 1.1) within 28 days of start of treatment by having
             measurable disease defined as one or more lesions that can be accurately measured in
             one or more dimensions. Areas of previous radiation may not serve as measurable
             disease unless there is evidence of progression post radiation.

          -  At time of registration, if the patient has had previous treatment it must have been
             at least 4 weeks since major surgery or radiation therapy; four weeks from any other
             previous anti-cancer therapy including biologics. Patients must have recovered from
             their treatment-related events with the exception of alopecia.

          -  Are ≥18 years of age

          -  Have clinically acceptable laboratory screening results within certain limits
             specified below:

               -  AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) or less than or equal to 5
                  times ULN if liver metastases are present

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x UL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500 cells/mm

               -  Platelets ≥ 150,000/mm3

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl

          -  Have an ECOG performance status of ≤ 2

          -  Women of child-producing potential must agree to use effective contraceptive methods
             prior to study entry, during study participation, and for at least 30 days after the
             last administration of study medication. A serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior
             to the initiation of therapy will be required for women of childbearing potential.

          -  Have the ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written
             informed consent, abide by the study restrictions, and agree to return for the
             required assessments.

          -  Able to tolerate oral medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 150mmHg or
             diastolic blood pressure greater than 100mmHg); or history of congestive heart
             failure (equal to or greater than Grade 2).

          -  Have active angina pectoris, stroke, previous myocardial infarction within the past
             12 months and not clinically stable, or any other pre-existing uncontrolled
             cardiovascular condition.

          -  Have chronic atrial fibrillation or QTc interval corrected for heart rate of greater
             than 470 msec.

          -  Require therapeutic doses of anti-coagulation with warfarin or other coumarin

          -  Known CNS metastases

          -  Have any medical condition that would impair the administration of oral agents
             including recurrent bowel obstructions, inflammatory bowel disease or uncontrolled
             nausea, vomiting or diarrhea

          -  Have persistent 2+ protein by urinalysis (patients with 2+ proteinuria that have a
             spot protein:creatinine ratio of less than 0.3 may be enrolled) or a history of
             nephrotic syndrome

          -  Have an active or history of additional malignancy which in the opinion of the study
             doctor would make assessment of outcome difficult.

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the long-term side effects of the continuation of oral ONC201 in
      treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body who have
      previously benefited from receiving this drug. Oral ONC201 may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of ONC201 (oral ONC201) administered
      orally in patients with advanced cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize pharmacokinetics of ONC201. II. To assess serum biomarkers of therapeutic
      response to ONC201. III. To assess preliminary antitumor activity of ONC201 as a single
      agent in advanced solid tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral ONC201 orally (PO) on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is receiving concomitant standard and/or investigational anticancer therapy;
             local palliative radiotherapy is permissible upon discussion with the principal
             investigator

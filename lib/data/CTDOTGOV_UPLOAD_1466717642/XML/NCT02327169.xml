  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile and the maximum
      tolerated doses (MTDs/potential recommended phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) of the combination
      treatments of MLN2480 + MLN0128, MLN2480 + alisertib, MLN2480 + paclitaxel, MLN2480 +
      cetuximab, and MLN2480 + irinotecan in patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called MLN2480. MLN2480 is being tested to evaluate
      side effects and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for future
      studies when administered in combination with three other medications. This study will
      assess the safety of MLN2480 as well as how it is processed by the body in participants with
      solid nonhematologic malignancies who have failed standard therapies.

      The study will be conducted in two phases, the Dose Escalation Phase and the Dose Expansion
      Phase. Approximately 49 participatns will be enrolled in the Escalation phase. Participants
      in this phase will be assigned to one of the five treatment groups:

        -  MLN2480 + MLN0128

        -  MLN2480 + Alisertib

        -  MLN2480 + Paclitaxel

        -  MLN2480 + Cetuximab

        -  MLN2480 + Irinotecan

      Once the MTD for each combination treatment arm has been established in the Escalation
      Phase, one or more of the combination treatments will be selected for the Expansion Phase.
      Approximately 76 participants will be enrolled in the Expansion Phase.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 14 months. Participants will make approximately 43 visits to the
      clinic including an end of study visit 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.
Serious adverse event (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event. Relationship of each AE to study drug will be determined by the Investigator.</description>

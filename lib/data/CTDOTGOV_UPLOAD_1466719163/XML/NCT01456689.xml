  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this dose escalation study is to estimate the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of LGH447 as a single agent when
      administered orally once daily to adult patients with Multiple Myeloma (MM).

    <description>Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Serious adverse events are any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgment of investigators represent significant hazards.</description>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to develop a more effective and better tolerated regimen.
      Ixazomib appears to have greater activity than bortezomib with less peripheral neuropathy.

                  usual lifestyle of the subject and obtain a serum pregnancy test, which must
                  come back negative prior to drug. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods

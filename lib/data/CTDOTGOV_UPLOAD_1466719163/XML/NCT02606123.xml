  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 parts: Part I (Dose Escalation) and Part II (Dose Expansion). In
      Part I, patients will participate in single, multiple, and long-term dosing periods using
      EPI-506 to determine safety, pharmacokinetics, the maximum tolerated dose, and preliminary
      indications of anti-tumor activity. Part I is an open-label, adaptive 3 + 3 design,
      dose-escalation study. Up to six dose levels of EPI-506 will be studied, beginning at 80
      mg/day. Patients may be allowed to escalate sequentially to a higher dose cohort after
      twelve weeks of dosing.

      In Part II, 3 patient populations; post-abiraterone metastatic castration-resistant prostate
      cancer (mCRPC) but enzalutamide-naïve, post-enzalutamide mCRPC but abiraterone-naïve, and
      post-abiraterone and enzalutamide mCRPC will be studied at the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) determined in Part I over 12 weeks of daily dosing. Approximately 120 patients (40 in
      each cohort) will be enrolled.

    <description>Patients will receive EPI-506 as an oral soft gel capsule.
Part 1:
Six planned cohort doses will be studied beginning at 80mg/day. During the Single Dose Period, patients will first receive a dose of EPI-506 in the fasted state followed by 2 days of washout, and then patients will receive a second dose of EPI-506 in the fed state followed by 2 days of washout. Patients will then enter the Multiple Dosing and Long-term Dosing Period where they will receive daily dosing until they meet discontinuation criteria.
Part 2:
The dose in Part 2 will be determined in Part 1 of the study. Patients in will receive the Part 2 dose daily until they meet discontinuation criteria.</description>

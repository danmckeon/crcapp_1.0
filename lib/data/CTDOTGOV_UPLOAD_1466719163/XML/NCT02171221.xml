    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, open label, single arm, sequential dose escalation and expansion
      study of oral DFP-11207 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DFP-11207 is an investigational agent that has demonstrated reasonable antitumor activity in
      preclinical animal tumor models. The DFP-11207 drug product is supplied as oral capsules to
      be taken once daily for 28 days of a 28-day treatment cycle.

  <study_design>Endpoint Classification: Safety/Efficacy Study, Intervention Model: Single Group Assignment, Masking: Open Label, Primary Purpose: Treatment</study_design>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of daily oral dosing of DFP-11207 in patients with solid tumors</measure>
    <time_frame>Continuous starting on day of first dose (Day 1) up to 30 days after last dose</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The MTD and tolerability will be based on the incidence of adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities in patients. CTCAE 4.0 will be used to grade the severity of adverse events.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics (PK): To measure plasma and urine concentrations of DFP-11207 and its metabolites</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1, Day 1: 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours post-dose; and on Days 15 and 29</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>PK parameters to be measured include area under the concentration curve versus time (AUC) and maximum drug concentration (Cmax)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine preliminary efficacy (overall response rate) in solid tumor patients receiving oral DFP-11207</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have pathologically-confirmed solid tumors, refractory after standard
             therapy for the disease or for which conventional systemic chemotherapy is not
             reliably effective or no effective therapy is available.

          2. Aged ≥ 18 years.

          3. ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          4. Adequate clinical laboratory values defined as:

               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L

               -  platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L

               -  plasma creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for the institution

               -  bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

               -  alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt; 2.5 x ULN (&lt; 5 x
                  ULN if documented hepatic metastases)

          5. Absence of uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses, including uncontrolled infections,
             cardiac conditions, or other organ dysfunctions.

          6. Patients may have measurable or non-measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1.

          7. Signed informed consent prior to the start of any study specific procedures.

          8. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test.
             Male and female patients must agree to use acceptable contraceptive methods for the
             duration of the study and for at least one month after the last drug administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             deficiency.

          2. Patients will be excluded if they have received previous chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
             radiotherapy or any other investigational therapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) or 5 half-lives for non-cytotoxic agents prior to this
             study entry.
